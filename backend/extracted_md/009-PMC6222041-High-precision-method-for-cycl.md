Abstract
Vertebral fractures associated with osteoporosis are often the result of tissue damage accumulated over time. Microscopic
tissue damage (microdamage) generated in vivo is believed to be a mechanically relevant aspect of bone quality that may
contribute to fracture risk. Although the presence of microdamage in bone tissue has been documented, the relationship
between loading, microdamage accumulation and mechanical failure is not well understood. The aim of the current study
was to determine how microdamage accumulates in human vertebral cancellous bone subjected to cyclic fatigue loading.
Cancellous bone cores (n = 32) from the third lumbar vertebra of 16 donors (10 male, 6 female, age 7668.8, mean 6 SD)
were subjected to compressive cyclic loading at s/E0 = 0.0035 (where s is stress and E0 is the initial Young’s modulus). Cyclic
loading was suspended before failure at one of seven different amounts of loading and specimens were stained for
microdamage using lead uranyl acetate. Damage volume fraction (DV/BV) varied from 0.860.5% (no loading) to 3.462.1%
(fatigue-loaded to complete failure) and was linearly related to the reductions in Young’s modulus caused by fatigue
loading (r2 = 0.60, p,0.01). The relationship between reductions in Young’s modulus and proportion of fatigue life was
nonlinear and suggests that most microdamage generation occurs late in fatigue loading, during the tertiary phase. Our
results indicate that human vertebral cancellous bone tissue with a DV/BV of 1.5% is expected to have, on average, a
Young’s modulus 31% lower than the same tissue without microdamage and is able to withstand 92% fewer cycles before
failure than the same tissue without microdamage. Hence, even small amounts of microscopic tissue damage in human
vertebral cancellous bone may have large effects on subsequent biomechanical performance.

Introduction
Vertebral fractures are the most common form of osteoporosis-
related fractures [1,2]. Only 51% of all vertebral fractures are
associated with a discrete loading event, suggesting that many
vertebral fractures are the result of tissue damage caused by
multiple loading events over time [3,4]. Cancellous bone is the
primary load-carrying component in human vertebral bodies,
suggesting that damage accumulation and related degradation in
biomechanical performance of vertebral cancellous bone is part of
the development of vertebral fractures [5].
Microscopic tissue damage (microdamage) in the form of linear
microcracks, diffuse damage, or trabecular microfracture occurs
in vivo [6,7], shows a higher prevalence in older individuals
[8,9,10], and is believed to be a biomechanically relevant aspect of
bone quality [11]. Microdamage in bone tissue can be visualized
through bulk staining with basic fuchsin [12] or fluorochromes
[13,14] followed by sectioning and histomorphometry. Alterna-
tively microdamage may be stained using radio-opaque contrast
agents combined with x-ray computed tomography (micro-CT,
etc) [15,16,17]. Previous studies have demonstrated that greater
amounts of cyclic loading applied to cortical bone tissue are related
to greater amounts of microdamage [18,19,20,21,22,23]. In
cancellous bone, relations between a single loading event and
the amount of resulting microdamage have been reported
[16,24,25,26], but less is known about microdamage accumulation
during cyclic fatigue loading.
Cancellous bone tissue submitted to cyclic loading displays
creep-fatigue behavior in three phases: a primary phase in which
stiffness reduces relatively rapidly, a secondary phase in which
stiffness declines slowly and a tertiary phase in which stiffness
rapidly declines before failure (Fig. 1) [27,28,29]. Microdamage
generated during fatigue loading has been examined in bovine
cancellous bone [13,30,31] and in human femoral cancellous bone
after an initial overload [32], but quantitative relationships
between the amount of fatigue loading, microdamage and
alterations in biomechanical performance in less dense cancellous
bone such as that in the vertebral body have not yet been
presented. Human vertebral cancellous bone is more rod-like and

porous than cancellous bone tissue from the femoral neck and is
therefore expected to show different failure processes [33].
The overall goal of the current line of investigation is to
understand
the
contributions
of
microdamage
to
vertebral
fractures. Specifically, the aim of the current study is to determine
the relationship between the amount of fatigue loading, the
accumulation of microdamage, and reductions in the Young’s
modulus during cyclic loading of human vertebral cancellous
bone.
Methods
Sample Preparation
The third lumbar vertebral bodies of 16 donors (10 male, 6
female, mean age 7668.8 years, range 62–92 years) were
examined (tissue from NDRI, Philadelphia, PA). The work
examined human tissue acquired from a licensed tissue bank
(http://ndriresource.org/) and was therefore exempt from Insti-
tutional Review Board evaluation. Donors had no medical history
of metabolic bone disease or cancer. Vertebrae were dissected free
of soft tissue and cylindrical cores of cancellous bone (nominally
8 mm diameter, 19 mm in length) aligned in the superior-inferior
direction (as described previously [34]) were collected using a
diamond tipped coring tool (Starlite Industries, Bryn Mawr, PA,
USA).
Trabecular
alignment
was ensured
by aligning
the
vertebrae visually during specimen collection. Two specimens
were collected from each vertebra resulting in a total of 32
specimens. Specimens from the anterior, left, or right sites in the
vertebra were included in the study. Little variation in mechanical
properties has been observed among anterior, left and right sites
within lumbar vertebrae [35,36,37]. Samples from the posterior
side were avoided because of bone volume fraction inhomogeneity
due to the vascular supply. Specimens were wrapped in saline
soaked gauze and stored in airtight containers at 220uC until
mechanical testing. Prior to mechanical testing, bone marrow was
removed from the specimens with a low-pressure water jet. The
specimens were glued (Loctite 401, Newington, CT, USA) into
brass cylindrical end-caps as previously described [34]. The
cyanoacrylate glue was allowed to cure overnight at 4uC, with
specimens wrapped in saline soaked gauze to maintain hydration.
Mechanical Loading
Fatigue loading was applied to the cancellous bone cores to
induce microdamage. Mechanical loading was conducted at room
temperature (23uC) using a servohydraulic testing machine (858
Mini Bionix, MTS, Eden Prairie, MN, USA) with a 1 kN load cell
(Model 661.18E-01, MTS, Eden Prairie, MN, USA, USA).
Mechanical properties degrade faster at higher temperatures
[28,38,39],
thus
testing
at
body
temperature
would
have
accelerated mechanical degradation compared to testing at room
temperature. By testing at room temperature in the current study,
microdamage propagated more slowly and we were better able to
stop fatigue loading at prescribed amounts of fatigue loading.
Strain was measured with a 25 mm gage length extensometer
attached to the end-caps. The effective gage length was defined as
the exposed plus half the embedded length of the specimen [34].
During testing, specimens were hydrated with physiologically
buffered saline (pH of 7.4) containing 10 mM protease inhibitors
(E-64, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). A rubber membrane
placed around the specimen was used to contain the solution.
Mechanical loading consisted of an initial set of ten precondition-
ing cycles between 0 and 0.1% strain at a rate of 0.5%/sec. After
preconditioning, the specimens were submitted to cyclic loading
between 0 N and a load corresponding to a value of s/E0 of
0.0035 mm/mm, where s is stress and E0 is the initial Young’s
modulus. Fatigue loading was performed at 4 Hz in load control
using a haversine waveform.
Six specimens were loaded to 5% strain, which we defined as
failure (group 7). The value of 5% strain was defined as failure,
because from preliminary tests it was found that loading to 5%
strain would capture the primary, secondary, and tertiary phase.
Our definition is conservative in that others have defined failure at
lower strain magnitudes (2.5% [30] or even ‘‘the cycle before
which a specimen could no longer sustain the applied stress’’
which was at a strain of 3.36% 62.13% [29]). Five specimens were
not subjected to fatigue loading (group 1). Fatigue loading in five
other groups was stopped before failure based on monitoring the
creep-fatigue curve, secant modulus, and hysteresis loops to
achieve specimens loaded to a specified region of the creep-fatigue
curve. Fatigue loading was stopped at the start of the secondary
phase (group 2), in the middle of the secondary phase (group 3),
and at three different points within the tertiary phase (groups 4–6).
Specimen group assignment was performed to evenly distribute
male and female donors and ensure that multiple specimens from

the same donor were not in the same group. After loading, the
stress-strain curves were examined to confirm group classification
based on reduction in Young’s modulus (1 2 E/E0), and
specimens were reassigned group number if necessary. Eleven
specimens were reassigned group based on the Young’s modulus
reduction.
Reassignment
did
not
alter
the
relatively
even
distribution of male/female donors and specimens among donors.
The distribution in Young’s modulus reduction is shown in
Figure 2B (inset): For group 1 (n = 5) no fatigue loading was
applied, for the other groups the Young’s modulus reduction was
6–9% (group 2, n = 4), 12–17% (group 3, n = 3), 32–35% (group 4,
n = 4), 37–43% (group 5, n = 5), 44–51% (group 6, n = 4) or 57–
82% (group 7, n = 6).
Mechanical Properties
Force and strain data were collected every cycle at 102.4 Hz,
and at 1024 Hz every tenth cycle and during the last 10 cycles
(MTS TestSuite Multipurpose Elite/FlexTest 40 digital controller,
MTS, Eden Prairie, MN, USA). Young’s modulus was calculated
from the data sampled at 1024 Hz. Young’s modulus (E) was
determined with a polynomial fit of the first 0.2% portion of the
loading segment [40]. Force data was converted to stress using the
cross-sectional area of the specimen gage region. Creep strain,
cyclic strain, and maximum strain were determined per cycle
(Fig. 1B). Creep strain was defined as the minimum strain and
cyclic strain as the difference between the maximum and
minimum strain per cycle [41,42]. Maximum strain was the sum
of the creep and cyclic strain [28,29]. Energy dissipation (U),
which describes the amount of energy lost per cycle, was calculated
as the area within the hysteresis loop of each cycle. The number of
cycles to failure (Nf) was determined for specimens loaded to
failure (defined as achieving a maximum strain of 5%).
Microdamage and Bone Microarchitecture
After mechanical testing, specimens were removed from the
end-caps using a low-speed diamond saw (Isomet, Buehler Ltd.,
Lake Bluff, IL) and stained with lead uranyl acetate. Lead uranyl
acetate binds to regions of bone tissue in which microdamage has
formed [43] and has high x-ray absorption, allowing visualization
of microdamage with micro-computed tomography [16,17]. Lead
uranyl acetate staining was performed as follows (derived from
[16]): cylindrical cores were dehydrated in 70% acetone for 24
hours. Next, the specimens were stained for one week in a solution
of equal parts 8% uranyl acetate (Ted Pella, Inc., Redding, CA,
USA ) in 70% acetone and 20% lead (II) acetate (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, USA) in 70% acetone, while on a shaker covered
to limit exposure to light. Thereafter, the samples were placed in a
1% ammonium sulfide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in
70% acetone solution for one week with one change of solution at
3 days. Samples were rinsed with 70% acetone, submersed in 70%
acetone for one week, rinsed again and submitted to ultrasonic
vibration for 10 minutes in 70% acetone to remove the solution
from the pores. Specimens were glued on metal nails. Images were
collected
with
X-ray
microscopy
(VersaXRM-500,
Xradia,
Pleasanton, CA, USA) in air at an energy of 100 kVp, a current
of 90 mA, an integration time of 1000 ms, and an isotropic voxel
size of 10 mm. The region of interest was 10.2 mm in length and
contained the complete cross-sections of the specimen. The
volume analyzed was 7.5 mm in diameter (at least 250 mm away
from machined edges) and 8.2 mm in length (central slices), unless
the specimen was shorter, in which case the volume analyzed
started 500 mm below the machined edge. To segment bone, a
Gaussian filter (sigma = 1.2, support = 1) was applied to the
images, followed by a global threshold, determined with the Otsu
method. To segment microdamage from bone, manual thresholds
were chosen by an observer blinded to the experimental group of
each specimen. Bone microarchitecture was quantified using a
three-dimensional approach (IPL, Scanco Medical, Bru¨ttisellen,
Switzerland), including bone volume fraction (BV/TV), trabecular
thickness, trabecular number, bone surface, structure model index,
connectivity density, and degree of anisotropy. Damage volume
fraction was calculated as the damage volume divided by the bone
volume (DV/BV).
Statistical Analysis
Regression was performed to determine the relationship
between loading group (as an ordinal) and mechanical properties
or DV/BV. Regression models were also performed to determine
relations
between
microdamage,
mechanical
properties
and
measures of cancellous microarchitecture. Donor was included
as a random effect to take into account the use of multiple
specimens from each donor. Statistical tests were conducted using
JMP 9 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) or MATLAB (7.12.1,
R2011a, The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, USA).

proportion of fatigue life used. The numbers and colored ranges on the curve indicate the points where fatigue loading was stopped for each group
(the range shown in the inset).

Results
Damage Volume Fraction
Damage volume fraction was increased in specimens receiving
more fatigue loading (r2 = 0.71, p,0.01, Fig. 3B). DV/BV was
0.8% 60.6% (mean6SD) in samples with no fatigue loading and
3.4% 62.1% in the group loaded to failure. Although there was
considerable variability within each loading group, within a donor,
DV/BV was greater in specimens with greater amounts of fatigue
loading (visualization of specimens from the same donor in Fig. 4).
Mechanical Properties
Young’s modulus was reduced in specimens receiving more
fatigue loading (r2 = 0.96, p,0.01, Fig. 3A). Maximum strain was
increased in specimens receiving more fatigue loading, but did not
exceed 2% in the groups where cyclic loading was stopped before
failure (Groups 1–6, Fig. 3C). Maximum energy dissipation
ranged between 0.1 mJ/mm3 and 1.3 mJ/mm3 for groups 2–6, and
increased to an average of 4.6 mJ/mm3 for group 7 (r2 = 0.65,
p,0.01, Fig. 3D). Early during fatigue loading the maximum
strain was similar to the cyclic strain, but with continued loading,
creep strain increased (Fig. 5A), indicating that changes in
maximum strain were mostly an effect of accumulation of creep
strain. Maximum strain was related to both creep strain (r2 = 0.95,
p,0.01) and cyclic strain (r2 = 0.64, p,0.01, Table 1). In contrast
to the continuous reduction in Young’s modulus throughout
fatigue loading, energy dissipation remained relatively constant
and only increased in the tertiary phase (Fig. 5B).
Relationship between Damage Volume Fraction and
Mechanical Properties
Greater
amounts
of
microdamage
were
associated
with
reductions in mechanical properties (Fig. 6). DV/BV was
positively related to modulus reduction (r2 = 0.60, p,0.01) and
maximum strain (r2 = 0.61, p,0.01). Creep strain (r2 = 0.57,
p,0.01), cyclic strain (R2 = 0.54, p,0.01), and energy dissipation
(r2 = 0.53, p,0.01) were positively correlated with DV/BV
(Table 1, Table 2, Fig. S1).
Relationship between Damage Volume Fraction and
Fatigue Life
The relationship between reductions in Young’s modulus and
proportion of fatigue life was consistent among specimens loaded
to failure (n = 6, Fig. 2A) allowing quantitative estimates of the
relationship between DV/BV and proportion of fatigue life by
combining the relationship between the reduction in Young’s
modulus and proportion of fatigue life (Fig. 2B) with the
relationship between the reduction in Young’s modulus and
DV/BV (Fig. 6A). The relationship between DV/BV and the
proportion of fatigue life was nonlinear, with most damage
accumulation late in the fatigue life (Fig. 7). A DV/BV of 1.5%
(95% CI: 1.1–1.9%) corresponded, on average, to a 31%
reduction in Young’s modulus and to 92% (95% CI: 88–96%)
of the fatigue life. A DV/BV of 2% was associated, on average,
with 98% of the fatigue life.
Effect of Cancellous Microarchitecture on Microdamage
Accumulation
No differences in bone microarchitectural parameters (Table 3)
were detected among groups. No correlations between DV/BV
and microarchitecture were observed (Table 2, Fig. S1).
Including microarchitectural parameters as a covariate in the
regression between DV/BV and mechanical properties did not
improve the correlation coefficients.

Discussion
The current study provides the first quantitative measures of
stained microdamage accumulation during cyclic loading in
human vertebral cancellous bone and shows that microdamage
generated by cyclic loading is linearly related to reductions in
specimen stiffness and non-linearly related to the proportion of
fatigue life. Additionally, our results suggest that microdamage has
a greater effect on fatigue life of cancellous bone tissue than it does
on Young’s modulus.
There are a number of strengths to the current study. First, our
study describes microdamage accumulation with cyclic loading
both in terms of microscopically observed microdamage as well as
reductions in specimen stiffness. Second, cyclic loading was
applied to vertebral cancellous bone from elderly humans with
low bone volume fraction (BV/TV range 5–15%), thereby
characterizing the population in which vertebral fractures are
more prevalent. Third, microdamage was quantified in three-
dimensions. Examination of microdamage in three-dimensions
reduces variance in microdamage measures by measuring the
entire specimen [44].
There are some limitations that must be considered in
interpreting our results. First, the current study measured micro-
damage based on lead uranyl acetate staining. Lead uranyl acetate
binds to exposed phosphate on the bone surface (e.g. hydroxyap-
atite crystals) [45]. Recent studies have demonstrated that
fluorescent dyes used to stain microdamage do not stain all
regions of permanent deformation within bone tissue [46,47,48].
Hence, it is possible that there are small forms of microdamage
that are not stained by lead uranyl acetate. Nevertheless, in a study
where high resolution imaging (order of 10 nm voxel size) was
performed, lead uranyl acetate staining was typically localized to
areas of maximum stress [17], suggesting lead uranyl acetate
binding occurred in the regions where microdamage would be
expected. Second, our staining protocol is expected to stain
microdamage caused by fatigue loading as well as any pre-existing
microdamage that had been caused in vivo. The use of multiple
specimens from each donor mediated the effect of pre-existing
damage on our results, as can be seen by the fact that in all but one
donor increasing amounts of fatigue loading were associated with
increased amounts of stained microdamage. Third, a limitation of

our study was that the maximum applied strain (3500 me) was
greater than is common during activities in vivo. Lifting an 8 kg
weight has been estimated to induce an in vivo apparent strain of
2300 me in vertebral cancellous bone [49]. Thus, an apparent
strain of 3500 me is representative of an overload, but is still
considerably lower than required for failure [50]. The maximum
strain level was selected to balance the goals of attaining
observable microdamage while limiting the amount of degradation
of the material from environmental conditions (temperature, etc.)
during loading [19,51,52].
The current study provides a detailed description of the
accumulation of microdamage during fatigue loading in human
vertebral cancellous bone, making it possible to estimate the
biomechanical importance of microdamage, including that pre-
sumably generated in vivo in donor tissue [7,53]. Determination of
the relation between microdamage accumulation and reductions
in Young’s modulus is not entirely new in itself; others have
described such relations in bovine cancellous bone or cortical
bone, but the current study is the first to determine the relation for
human cancellous bone. Consistent with the linear relation
between damage volume fraction and reduction in Young’s
modulus reported here, Moore and colleagues found that the
number of damaged trabeculae per total section area increased
linearly with increasing modulus reduction in bovine cancellous
bone [30].
Our measures of microdamage are of similar magnitude as
previous studies. In the current study, the damage volume fraction
ranged between 0.3% and 7.4%. In bovine cancellous bone
subjected to an overload the damage volume fraction was
4.5462.94%
[15]
and
the
damaged
area
fraction
was
3%61.9% [24]. Similar ranges in microdamage are achieved in
our laboratory using serial milling or two-dimensional sections.
Nevertheless, our measures of microdamage are much smaller
than in vivo microdamage reported from analysis of basic fuchsin,

where the percent bone area with diffuse damage reached values
up to 50% [53]. Differences in damage volume fraction could arise
from the fact that in the current study microdamage was induced
by mechanical loading, which may differ from microdamage
sustained in vivo. In the current study, microdamage was induced
by cyclic compressive loading, while in vivo there is more likely a
mixed loading mode including bending and torsion that might
cause differences in the amount of microdamage. Also, differences
in the population of the subjects investigated with the current
study only containing older donors (range 62–92 years) and the
previous study including younger donors (range 23–96 years) could
lead to differences in damage volume fraction. Furthermore,
staining methodology (lead uranyl acetate v. basic fuchsin),
sectioning (three-dimensional v. two-dimensional sections) or
measurement (thresholding v. point counts) could have contribut-
ed to the differences in the magnitudes of microdamage. The
damage volume fraction in the current study was also lower than
that generated in vitro and visualized using lead uranyl acetate
[16,54], where DV/BV was as high as 25%. Differences in skeletal
region examined could contribute to the observed differences in
microdamage. Vertebral cancellous bone is more rod-like and
porous than bone from the femoral neck or tibial plateau (used by
the Vashishth laboratory). Failure mechanisms of cancellous bone
have been shown to differ between plate-like and rod-like bone
[33], with tissue predominantly yielding in plates [55]. Therefore,
more microdamage might accumulate in tibial or femoral
cancellous bone before failure than in vertebral cancellous bone.
There are also possible differences between damage generated
from uniaxial loading (previous studies) and from fatigue loading
(the current study). In addition, other factors including the lead
uranyl acetate staining protocol (immersion time, rinsing method-
ology), image resolution, micro-CT settings (energy and integra-
tion time) and thresholding (manual v. automated thresholding
with Otsu) may contribute to the differences in DV/BV between
our study and studies of the Vashishth laboratory. To examine the
effect of thresholding we analyzed the specimens with manually
selected thresholds and found a similar range in DV/BV to that
determined with the Otsu method (0.3–7.4% manually v. 0.9–
8.8% with Otsu) and found that global thresholds necessary to
achieve DV/BV measures as high as 25% did not match user
observations, suggesting that global threshold selection alone is less
likely to explain the differences in magnitude of DV/BV between
our study and prior work. Further study is necessary to identify the
true reason(s) for the differences.

In agreement with previous studies that have clearly shown that
creep
contributes
to
fatigue
behavior
in
cancellous
bone
[28,29,56], creep strain dominated the accumulation of strain.
Whether creep strain contributed to microdamage accumulation
was, however, less clear since DV/BV and creep strain were
correlated (Fig. S1) and in vivo loading models in animals have
shown that creep loading causes microdamage [57,58]. Neverthe-
less, others have proposed that the contribution of creep strain on
damage accumulation is negligible [29,52,59], because most of the
creep strain is recoverable upon unloading and can therefore only
cause minor permanent deformation to cancellous bone [56].
Maximum strain was the single best predictor of DV/BV (tested
using multivariate linear regressions), which is consistent with a
strain-based failure criterion for cancellous bone [30,42,60],
however, because creep strain and maximum strain were highly
correlated it is not possible to conclude which was causative.
Consistent with previous studies that found no effect of gender
on fatigue properties in bone [32,61], the current study did not
detect differences in fatigue properties between male and female
samples.
In contrast to others that have reported correlations between the
bone microstructure and bone microdamage [54,62,63,64], in the
current study DV/BV did not correlate with the bone micro-
architecture, and the bone microarchitecture did not appear to
influence the relationship between DV/BV and modulus reduc-
tion. In the current study BV/TV ranges from 5.5% to 15.0%
while prior examinations of microdamage in cancellous bone have
ranged from 17.6% to 38.4% [64]. Thus the current study may
not have had a sufficient range in microarchitecture to detect a
correlation between microdamage and microarchitecture.
Although the current study did not examine the bone
ultrastructure, it is useful to consider the mechanisms of energy
dissipation that can explain changes in mechanical properties with
fatigue loading. Bone is a hierarchical structure with energy
dissipation mechanisms at different length scales of bone [65]. To
resist fracture, bone tissue can deform through fibrillar sliding or
through the formation of microcracks [66,67], where larger
microcracks dissipate greater amounts of energy. Our observation
of a correlation between DV/BV and energy dissipation per cycle
are consistent with the idea that microdamage contributes to
energy dissipation in cancellous bone. We speculate that in the
secondary phase of fatigue loading crack-limiting boundaries (such
as cement lines) limited the size of microdamage and therefore the
amount of energy dissipation, while in the tertiary phase,
microcracks extended through boundaries and result in greater
microcracks with greater levels of energy dissipation.
Our study provides a quantitative estimation of the relationship
between DV/BV and proportion of fatigue life. Our findings
suggest that small amounts of microdamage in human vertebral
cancellous bone cause reductions in fatigue life that are much
greater than reductions in Young’s modulus. Therefore, even
small amounts of stained microdamage may indicate large
reductions in the number of loading cycles that the tissue can
sustain before failure even when alterations in cancellous bone
stiffness are small. Although the current study examined only the
effects of microdamage generated by cyclic compressive loading,
we expect our estimations of the effects of microdamage on
subsequent biomechanical performance to be conservative be-
cause alterations in loading mode and mixed mode loading have
been shown to be more effective at propagating microdamage
[26,64]. Recognizing the limitations of our study mentioned
above, the current study provides a means of estimating the
biomechanical importance of in vivo microdamage observed within
cancellous bone tissue.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated the relation between
microscopically observed microdamage, reductions in specimen
stiffness and reduced fatigue life during cyclic loading of human
vertebral cancellous bone. Our findings suggest that microdamage
has a much greater effect on fatigue life than on Young’s modulus
and provide a means to estimate the biomechanical repercussions
of in vivo microdamage observed in tissue from patients.
