Abstract
Data “publication” seeks to appropriate the prestige of authorship in the peer-reviewed liter-
ature to reward researchers who create useful and well-documented datasets. The scholar-
ly communication community has embraced data publication as an incentive to document
and share data. But, numerous new and ongoing experiments in implementation have not
yet resolved what a data publication should be, when data should be peer-reviewed, or how
data peer review should work. While researchers have been surveyed extensively regard-
ing data management and sharing, their perceptions and expectations of data publication
are largely unknown. To bring this important yet neglected perspective into the conversa-
tion, we surveyed * 250 researchers across the sciences and social sciences– asking
what expectations“data publication” raises and what features would be useful to evaluate
the trustworthiness, evaluate the impact, and enhance the prestige of a data publication.
We found that researcher expectations of data publication center on availability, generally
through an open database or repository. Few respondents expected published data to be
peer-reviewed, but peer-reviewed data enjoyed much greater trust and prestige. The impor-
tance of adequate metadata was acknowledged, in that almost all respondents expected
data peer review to include evaluation of the data’s documentation. Formal citation in the
reference list was affirmed by most respondents as the proper way to credit dataset crea-
tors. Citation count was viewed as the most useful measure of impact, but download count
was seen as nearly as valuable. These results offer practical guidance for data publishers
seeking to meet researcher expectations and enhance the value of published data.
Introduction
Data sharing
In 1985– almost 30 years ago– Stephen Ceci surveyed 847 scientists and concluded “it is clear
that scientists in all fields endorse the principle of data sharing as a desirable norm of science”
[1]. This endorsement has not weakened over the decades; more than 65% of faculty at Califor-
nia Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) affirmed the importance of data sharing in 2010
[2], as did 94% of the researchers in the United Kingdom (UK) surveyed by the Expert Advisor

Group on Data Access (EAGDA) in 2013 [3]. The respondents in 1985 survey endorsed data
sharing “to allow replication and extension of one’s own findings” [1], and enabling replication
and (re)use is still the principal motive behind data sharing. The reproducibility problem
plaguing science in the scholarly [4–6] and mainstream [7–9] press could be addressed, in part,
by opening underlying data to scrutiny [10, 11]. Beyond confirming previous analyses, reuse of
existing data cuts research costs [12] and allows new questions to be addressed [13, 14]. Despite
the apparent enthusiasm for data sharing in principle, Ceci alleges that in practice, “something
is amiss in the academy.”
Researchers frequently fail to make data available, even when they support the idea or are
obliged to do so. Alsheikh-Ali et al. examined 351 articles and found that 59% did not satisfy
the data availability requirements of the journal that published them [15]. Vines et al. requested
data from 516 articles published between 1991 and 2011 and obtained it less than half (47%) of
the time [16]. Researchers themselves agree that this is a problem. In 1985, 59% of scientists
surveyed by Ceci complained that their colleagues were disinclined to share data [1]. Twenty-
five years later, 67% of respondents to an international survey by the Data Observation Net-
work for Earth (DataONE) affirmed that “[l]ack of access to data generated by other research-
ers or institutions is a major impediment to progress in science” and 50% felt that their own
research had suffered [17]. That same year, fewer than half of the 65% of Cal Poly faculty who
agreed that data sharing is important followed through to share their own data [2].
Why do researchers who believe in the importance of sharing data fail to carry through?
Previous surveys unearthed a number of reasons: concern about the ethical and legal issues
around human subject data, mistrust that others have the expertise to use the data appropriate-
ly, hope of wringing additional articles from the data, and fear that the data will be “stolen”
without credit or acknowledgment. For example, researchers brought up ethical concerns in re-
ports from the Research Information Network (RIN) in 2008 and EAGDA in 2014; in the 2014
report, this was the second most frequently mentioned constraint (by 55% of respondents) [3,
18]. The risk of losing publications from premature sharing came up in 60% of a series of inter-
views of United States (US) scientists in 2012, more than any other risk; fear of “data theft” was
mentioned in 32% of the interviews [19]. However, by far the most consistent reason given is
that preparing and documenting data to a high enough standard to be useful just takes too
much time.
In the UK, the RIN report described lack of time as a major constraint [18], and it was men-
tioned by 66% of respondents to EAGDA, more than any other constraint [3]. Time was
brought up by 44% of respondents to Kim and Stanton’s survey [19], more than any other cost.
It was the most frequent reason for not sharing data in the multidisciplinary DataONE survey
(named by 54% of respondents) [17] and the second most frequent in a follow-up survey of as-
trobiologists (named by 22%) [20]. Time investment was the second most frequently raised ob-
jection to data sharing in a 2012 survey of biodiversity researchers and the “most violently
discussed obstacle” in associated interviews [21].
Although the process of preparing and documenting data for sharing could undoubtedly be
streamlined with better planning, education, and tools, it will always take time and effort. The
underlying problem is that this time and effort is not rewarded. Lack of acknowledgment was
the third most popular objection in the biodiveristy survey and * 2/3 of respondents would be
more likely to share if they were recognized or credited when their data is used. In the EAGDA
report, 55% of respondents said that lack of tangible recognition and rewards constrains data
sharing, and at least 75% of respondents felt that the UK Research Excellence Framework
(REF) does not recognize data to some or great extent relative to publications, but that it
should. The need to compensate researchers who share data with scholarly prestige is a major
driver of the movement toward data publication.

Data publication
Data publication appropriates familiar terminology (“publication,” “peer review”) from the
scholarly literature in order to insinuate data into the existing academic reward system [22–
24]. The model of data publication that most closely mimics the existing literature is the data
paper. Data papers describe datasets, including the rationale and collections methods, without
offering any analysis or conclusions [25, 26]. Data papers appear in existing journals like
F1000Research and Internet Archaeology as well as new dedicated journals such as Earth System
Science Data, Geoscience Data Journal [27], and Nature Publishing Group’s Scientific Data–
which describes itself concisely as “a publication venue that credits scientists who share and ex-
plain their data” [28]. Data papers are invariably peer-reviewed based on the dataset; its de-
scription; and whether the two form a complete, consistent, and useable package [23]. The
appeal of data papers is straightforward: they are unquestionably peer-reviewed papers, so aca-
demia knows how (if perhaps not how much) to value them.
However, other data-publishing approaches abound. Data publishers include repositories
such as Dryad (http://www.datadryad.org/), figshare (http://figshare.com/), and Zenodo
(http://zenodo.org/) where researchers can self-deposit any kind of research data with light
documentation requirements and minimal validation. Dryad requires that data be associated
with a “reputable” publication, while figshare and Zenodo are completely open. Domain-spe-
cific repositories frequently have more stringent documentation requirements and access to
the domain knowledge needed for thorough evaluation. For instance, the National Snow and
Ice Data Center (NSIDC) evaluates incoming data in a complex process involving both internal
reviewers with technical expertise and external peers with domain knowledge [29]. As a final
example, Open Context publishes carefully processed and richly annotated archaeology data,
some of which passes through editorial and peer review [30]. One thing that all of these pub-
lishers have in common is that they endeavor to make datasets formally citable (in part through
assignment of stable identifiers) as a means to credit the creators.
The variety of forms of data publication attests to a general shortage of consensus on what,
exactly, it means to publish data. Noting a lack of both consensus and interest on the part of re-
searchers, the RIN report of 2008 adopted a deliberately minimal definition: “making datasets
publicly available” [18]. While eminently practical, this definition does not do much to distin-
guish publication from sharing (except for ruling out certain channels) or to advance its pres-
tige. More recently, Callaghan et al. (2012) suggested distinguishing between published
(available), and Published (also citable and peer-reviewed) data [31]. We have argued that the
consensus in the scholarly communications community– publishers, librarians, curators– is
that published data is openly available, documented, and citable, but that what kind of valida-
tion (if any) is required to qualify is still an open question [32]. It is easy to forget, however,
that what data publication means to the scholarly communication community is substantially
irrelevant. The point of calling data made public through whatever particular process “pub-
lished” is to exploit the meaning of the word to researchers; the important definition is what
data publication means to them. This paper surveys researchers to explore these kinds of se-
mantic gaps between the scholarly communication community and researchers and seeks to
ensure that researcher expectations are more obvious, so that data publishers can maximize the
return on their efforts.
Researchers have been surveyed about sharing data many times this decade, but not about
data publication [2, 3, 17, 19, 33–36] The RIN report of 2008 is the most recent survey to ask
researchers about data publication; while the conclusions are undeniably valuable it uses the
term broadly enough that it is difficult to make any distinction between attitudes towards shar-
ing data and publishing it [18]. Consequently, open questions abound: What would a

researcher expect data publication to mean? What about peer review of a dataset? Do current
models satisfy those expectations? What potential features of a data publication would be use-
ful for evaluating the quality of the data? For evaluating the contribution of the creator(s)? To
get this critical perspective we conducted an online survey of active researcher perceptions of
data publication.
Results
Demographics
We collected responses to an online survey of data publication practices and perceptions in
January and February of 2014 and received 281 unique responses. Because we distributed the
survey solicitation via social media and email lists and did not contact most recipients directly,
we cannot estimate with any accuracy how many researchers received the solicitation or calcu-
late a response rate. Our analysis was restricted to the 249 (81%) respondents who we deemed
to be active researchers (described in Table 1). Researchers from 20 countries responded, but
most were affiliated with institutions in the US (79%, n = 197). The institutions were largely ac-
ademic (85%, n = 204); 94% (n = 191) of those were focused on research rather than teaching.
By discipline, the largest response was from biologists (37%), followed by archæologists (13%),

social scientists (13%), and environmental scientists (11%). We heard from researchers across
the academic career spectrum: 41% (n = 102) were principal investigators/lab heads,
24% (n = 61) postdocs, and 16% (n = 41) grad students. We saw few significant differences in
responses between disciplines or roles, so we have presented the results in aggregate. For signif-
icance testing, we consolidated subdisciplines into 8 high-level disciplines. Given the number
of respondents, this survey should have 80% power to detect small effects by chi square (χ2)
test (size FC = 0.17) and 95% power to detect medium-small effects (FC = 0.22) [37]. For
breakdown of data by discipline or role, see the full– except for redactions to preserve anonym-
ity– raw dataset published in the University of California’s Merritt repository [38].
Background knowledge
We asked a number of questions to assess engagement and familiarity with data sharing and
publication (Fig. 1). Respondents rated their familiarity with three US federal government poli-
cies related to data sharing and availability. Because these policies are specific to the US, we re-
stricted this part of our analysis to respondents who work there. Respondents were most
familiar with the National Science Foundation (NSF)’s Data Management Plan requirement
[39]. Fewer than than half had heard of the United States Office of Science and Technology
Policy (OSTP) Open Data Initiative [40]. Although the directive will eventually affect virtually
all researchers who receive US government funding, awareness is most likely low because con-
crete policies have not been implemented yet. The much older National Institutes of Health
(NIH) data sharing policy [41] was enacted 11 years ago, but only four biologists (5%) claimed
to know all the details, fewer than the 18 (24%) who had never heard of it.
The recent rapid proliferation of data journals led us to ask about them specifically. A free
text box was provided for respondents to list any data journals that they could name. Only 40
respondents (16%) named any data journals. Ecological Archives was the most frequently
named, by 16 respondents. The second most frequent response was Nature Publishing Group’s
Scientific Data (named by 14), even though it had not started publishing at the time of the sur-
vey. Earth System Science Data (ESSD) (n = 7), Biodiversity Data Journal (n = 6) and Geoscience
Data Journal (n = 5) followed. A number of respondents listed non-journal data publishers: fig-
share (n = 6), Dryad (n = 3), and Zenodo(n = 1).
Fig 1. Researchers are generally unfamiliar with data-related funder policies. Respondents based at US
institutions self-reported their familiarity with three government funder policies: the Whitehouse OSTP Open
Data Initiative (n = 197), NSF Data Management Plan requirements (n = 197), and the NIH data sharing
policy (only biologists included, n = 76). White dots show the mean familiarity for each item; error bars depict
bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals.

Data sharing mechanisms
Data publication is a relatively new and unfamiliar concept to researchers, but most do have ex-
perience with and opinions about data sharing, and we explored those briefly before moving
on to publication. Many respondents (56%, n = 140) said that it is very important to share the
data that underlies a study; differences between disciplines were not statistically meaningful (χ2
= 39.1, p = 0.18). Most have experience sharing their data (68%, n = 168) or reusing another re-
searcher’s shared data (61%, n = 151). Of the researchers who shared, 58% (n = 98) saw their
data reused by someone and 62% (n = 61) of those reuse instances led to a published paper.
Most of the respondents who reused data published a paper with it (69%, n = 104).
Because some, but not all, means of sharing data satisfy the availability requirements of data
publication [32], we asked researchers with data sharing experience about the mode of trans-
mission (Fig. 2A–C). The supplied answer choices were the four methods for external data
sharing that emerged in interviews by Kim and Stanton (2012): email/direct contact, personal
website, journal website, and database or repository [19]. Email/direct contact was the most
frequently reported method for sharing: 87% (n = 146) of the respondents who shared data did
so directly, 82% (n = 82) were aware of other researchers obtaining their data directly, and 57%
(n = 86) of the respondents who reused data obtained it directly. The predominance of direct
contact is probably in part an artifact of awareness– respondents necessarily know when they
give someone their data directly, but they may not be notified when someone downloads it
from a repository or website. Eight respondents (5%) wrote-in that they had obtained data
through a channel we had not considered: extracting data from the text, tables, or figures of a
published paper.
Credit for sharing data
Rewarding data creators is a primary goal of data publication, so we asked how a dataset crea-
tor should be credited by a reuser (Fig. 3A.). The most common answer, from 83% (n = 126) of
respondents, was formal citation in the reference list. Acknowledgment also ranked highly at
62% (93). Most (30 out of 34) respondents who gave a free-text answer wrote some variant on
“it depends,” often citing one of two factors: the publication status of the dataset (e.g. “depends
on whether the data is already published”) and the role of the data in the paper (e.g. “author-
ship if data is [the] primary source of analysis, otherwise acknowledgment”). Because previous
studies reported differences in citation practices between disciplines [17, 18, 33], we tested
whether different disciplines responded differently (omitting Mathematics because the n was
too low to reliably test). Following the approach of Tenopir et al. (2011), we performed separate
χ2 tests for each of the four provided answer choices. Using a significance cutoff corrected for
multiple hypothesis testing of α = 0.05/4 = 0.0125, we did not detect a difference between disci-
plines (χ2  16.4, p  0.022).
We also asked respondents who had published with shared data how they actually credited
the creator. Reported practice fit well with theory: formal citation was the most popular meth-
od (63%, n = 81), followed by acknowledgment (50%, n = 70). A notable distinction was that
while a few respondents (16%, n = 24) said that it was appropriate to cite data informally in the
body of the text, none admitted to actually doing it (Fig. 3B.).
Many researchers fear that shared data might be used by “data vultures” who contribute lit-
tle and don’t acknowledge the source [19]. To assess how realistic this fear is, we asked respon-
dents whose data had been reused for a publication whether they felt adequately credited. Most
(63%, n = 54) felt satisfied, and a combined 78% (n = 67) felt the credit was appropriate or ex-
cessive. This left 22% (n = 13) who were unsatisfied; only 2 (2%) felt that the credit was “very
insufficient.” These differences in satisfaction could derive from different attitudes toward

appropriate credit. To test this, we collapsed responses into three categories (insufficient, ap-
propriate, and excessive) and tested for independence with each of the four provided answers
in data sharing credit, but none of the relationships were statistically meaningful (corrected α =
0.0125, χ2  3.26, p  0.20).
Expected features of data publication and peer review
The central question we hoped to answer is what “data publication” and “data peer review” ac-
tually mean to researchers. We decomposed the prevalent models of data publication into a set
of potential features and asked respondents to select all the features that would distinguish a
“published” dataset from a “shared” one (Fig. 4A). The most prevalent expectations relate to
Fig 3. Formal citation is the preferred method of crediting dataset creators. Respondents indicated (A.)
how a dataset creator should be credited, (B.) how they actually credited a dataset creator in the past, and
(C.) how satisfied they were with the credit they received the last time someone else published using their
data. (A., B.) Respondents could select more than one item for each question. Error bars depict bootstrapped
95% confidence intervals.

access: 68% (n = 166) expect a published dataset to be openly available and 54% (n = 133) ex-
pect it to be in a repository or database. Substantially more researchers expected a published
dataset to be accompanied by a traditional publication (43%, n = 105) than by a data paper
(22%, n = 55). Only a minority of 29% (n = 70) expected published data to have been peer-
reviewed.
Much of the prestige of scholarly publication derives from surviving the peer review process.
It is natural, then, that many data publication initiatives model their validation process on peer
review and employ the term for its prestige and familiarity. However, it is not obvious exactly
how literature peer review processes and criteria should be adapted for data or what guarantees
it should make. We asked what researchers expect from data peer review, providing a selection
of considerations that data reviewers might take into account (Fig. 4B). The most common re-
sponses sidestepped examination of the data itself; 90% (n = 220) of respondents expected eval-
uation of the methods and 80% (n = 196) of the documentation. There was little (22%, n = 53)
expectation that data reviewers would consider novelty or potential impact.
We tested for differences in expectations of both data publication and peer review among
disciplines and between research roles. No significant differences between roles emerged. The

(A.) publication and (B.) peer review in the context of data. Respondents could select more than one item for each question. Error bars depict bootstrapped

only two significant differences among disciplines related to structured metadata: discipline
had a significant effect on expectation of formal metadata in the publication process (corrected
α = 0.006, χ2 = 33.0, p = 2.6 × 10−5) and consideration of standardized metadata in peer review
(corrected α = 0.008, χ2 = 26.7, p = 3.8 × 10−4). In both cases, the most notable distinctions
were the expectations of a large fraction of environmental scientists: 63% (compared to 25% in
the population as a whole) for publication and 73% (compared to 39%) for peer review. This
popularity among environmental scientists may be driven by the use of a mature metadata
standard in the field, Ecological Metadata Language (EML) [42].
To learn whether respondents selected data publication features or peer-review assessments
independently or as coherent constellations of ideas, we performed Fisher exact tests of inde-
pendence between every pair of features (Fig. 5). Within data publication, we found a dense set
of statistically significant associations among items related to access and preservation (at the
α = 0.05 level, corrected to α = 0.0018). For example, repository deposit was linked to openly
availability (OddsRatio = 9.55, p = 7.6 × 10−14), assignment of unique identifier, (OR = 3.33,
p = 1.33 × 10−5), and both formal (OR = 4.49, p = 3.94 × 10−6) and rich (OR = 3.83, p = 1.14 ×
10−6) metadata. Formal and rich metadata were themselves linked (OR = 12.5, p = 2.7 × 10−14).
Formal metadata was also linked to assignment of a unique identifier, which is sensible in that
an identifier is meaningless without metadata (OR = 7.92, p = 5.05 × 10−11). Another carrier for
metadata, a data paper, was linked to both rich (OR = 3.64, p = 4.22 × 10−5) and formal (OR =
4.30, p = 1.32 × 10−5) metadata. Data papers were the only item associated with peer review
(OR = 3.00, p = 0.0011). Traditional papers had no significant associations at all; the closest
was with data paper (OR = 1.93, p = 0.023).
Potential considerations during peer review are also linked significantly (with a corrected
cutoff of α = 0.0033). Three assessments were strongly interlinked: from appropriate methods
to standardized metadata (OR = 7.91, p = 0.00081) to technical evaluation (OR = 4.56, p = 3.4 ×
10−6) and back (OR = 5.9, p = 7.9 × 10−5). Plausibility correlated with other factors that require
domain expertise: appropriate methods (OR = 4.51, p = 0.0014), adequate documentation (OR
= 4.87, p = 2.5−6), and novelty/impact (OR = 5.50, p = 1.1 × 10−5). Plausibility was the only as-
sociation for novelty/impact.
Valued data-publication features
Validation of published data facilitates use only if potential users trust the means of assessment.
To learn which means researchers trust, we presented respondents with four possible features
and asked how much to rate how much confidence each would confer (Fig. 6B). All four in-
spired at least some confidence in most researchers (ranging from 89% to 98%). Respondents
trusted peer review above all else: 72% (n = 175) said it conferred high or complete confidence
and only 2% (n = 4) would feel little or no confidence. The second most trusted indicator was
knowledge that a traditional paper had been published with the data; 56% (n = 137) would have
high or complete confidence. Reuse of the data by a third party came in third, with 43%
(n = 106). Description by a data paper was the least convincing at 37% (n = 89) high or complete
confidence, although reuse inspired little or no confidence in more respondents (11%, n = 25).
Beyond reuse, data publication should reward researchers who create useful datasets with
credit. To that end, we asked what metrics researchers would most respect when evaluating a
dataset’s impact (Fig. 6C). Respondents considered number of citations to be the most useful
metric; 49% (n = 119) found citation count highly or extremely useful. Unexpectedly, a sub-
stantial 32% (n = 77) felt the same way about number of downloads. The distinction between
citation and download counts shrinks to 9% if the comparison is made at the level of at least

somewhat useful (82% versus 73%). Only a minority of respondents considered search rank
(42%, n = 102) or altmetrics (37%, n = 91) to be even somewhat useful.
Even before quality or impact enter consideration, the prestige associated with publishing a
dataset is influenced by its format. We distilled a multiplicity of data publications formats to
four generic models- with or without a data paper and with or without peer review– and asked
respondents how much each would contribute to a researcher’s curriculum vitæ (Fig. 6D). As a
point of comparison, respondents also rated the value of a traditional paper; 60% (n = 145)
give one a great deal of weight and another 36% (n = 87) give it significant weight. The most
valuable data publication model was data published with a peer-reviewed data paper, but even
that was only given a great deal of weight by 10% (n = 23), although another 46% (n = 109)
gave it significant weight. A peer-reviewed dataset with no paper dropped to 5% (n = 12) giving
a great deal of weight, while an un-peer-reviewed data paper dropped to 1% (n = 2). Thus, peer
review outweighed having a data paper as a factor. A substantial, 27% (n = 65) would award an
un-peer-reviewed dataset no weight at all. For this question, which explicitly addressed evalua-
tion of dataset creators, we were particularly interested in the 26% (59) of survey respondents
who had experience on a tenure and promotions committee. We compared their responses to
each feature with those who had not served on a committee by χ2, but found no significant rela-
tionships (corrected α = 0.01, χ2  8.39, p  0.078).
Discussion
Demographics, statistical power, and bias
Although this survey was international in scope, most of the respondents were affiliated with
institutions in the United States. The respondents here (84% North American) resemble those
of the DataONE survey [17] (73% North American); many of the previous surveys were con-
ducted entirely in the US [1, 2, 19]. The in-depth reports prepared by EAGDA [3] and the RIN
[18] were carried out in the UK, where a single assessment framework, the REF dominates, cre-
ating a significantly different environment in terms of credit. The bulk of our responses (85%)
came from academic institutions, which is similar to DataONEs 81% [17]. Ceci’s initial survey
was academic [1], and Scaramozzino’s was conducted entirely at a single teaching-oriented
university [2]. In this respect, the population here is quite comparable to previous surveys.
Researchers in all of the major roles in academia and a variety of disciplines responded. In
terms of role, our respondents again resemble those of the DataONE survey. There, 47% were
professors and 13.5% grad students; here, 41% were principal investigators and 16% grad stu-
dents [17]. Most other surveys were restricted to principal investigators. An exception, the
EAGDA survey, still mostly (69%) heard from principal investigators [3]. Our largest response
was from biologists (37%), followed by archaeologists (13%), social scientists (13%), and envi-
ronmental scientists (11%). DataONE heard mostly from researchers in its area of focus, envi-
ronmental sciences and ecology (36%), followed by social science (16%) and biology (14%)
[17]. Scaramozzino’s survey included a high proportion of physicists and mathematicians, but
18% of respondents were biologists [2]. The EAGDA survey was heaviest in biomedical fields,
such as epidemiology and (26.8%), genetics/genomics (20%), but also featured 31.4% social
scientists [3].
Whereas DataONE uncovered statistically distinct data sharing attitudes between respon-
dents in different disciplines, we did not. The effect sizes observed in tables 21 and 22 of Teno-
pir et. al (2011) [17]– which most closely parallel the questions about appropriate credit for
sharing data presented here– range from an effect size of FC = 0.11 to 0.17. This survey should
have 80% sensitivity to an effect size at the top of this range, FC = 0.17, so we find it plausible
that the detection of statistically meaningful distinctions in one survey and not the other could

an artifact of the difference in statistical power (from an n of 1329 vs. 249) rather than a reflec-
tion of real differences in the respondent populations. However, 0.17 is comfortably a “small”
effect, so we are unlikely here to have missed large or even moderate effects by chance [37].
As is the case for many of the previous surveys, participation was voluntary and open, so
our sample may be biased toward researchers with an interest in data sharing and publication.
However, a high proportion of respondents (84%) did not name any data journals, especially
relative to the 40% of EAGDA respondents who were unfamiliar with the format [3]. That and
the low awareness of US federal policies (e.g., 35% of US respondents had never heard of the
NSF data management plan requirement and 62% had never heard of the OSTP Open Data
Initiative) suggest that our respondents are not atypically invested in these issues.
Data publication
The RIN report of 2008 concluded that “. . .‘publishing’ datasets means different things to dif-
ferent researchers” [18] and we found that little has changed. Even the most frequently named
defining feature in this survey, open availability, was only chosen by * 2/3 of respondents.
One respondent simply wrote “terms are confusing.” However, the emergence of systematic re-
lationships between some of the features demonstrates that the responses were not utterly con-
fused. We observed two, arguably three, independent concepts of data publication.
The most widely held concept centers on present and future access. Open availability tightly
correlates with the second most frequent feature, repository deposit. Repository deposit corre-
lates with three other conceptually related features (unique identification, rich metadata, and
formal metadata), and numerous interconnections unite all five of these features. This concept
of publication maps well onto virtually all present data publication implementations, including
lightweight approaches like figshare and Zenodo.
The second concept lingers from the pre-digital days of scholarly communication: published
data is data that has been used or described in a traditional journal article. Nearly half (43%) of
the respondents chose “basis of a research paper” as a defining feature of data publication. Sur-
prisingly, this and the previous concept did not compete, but were instead almost completely
independent. The traditional paper concept reflects how researchers speak (e.g. to “publish an
experiment” is to publish a research paper that uses the experiment), but does not match the
conversation in the scholarly communication community, where data that had been used or
described but not made available would not be considered to have been published and, con-
versely, data that has been made available but never used in a research paper might be. This
mismatch is a potential source of misunderstanding that the scholarly communication com-
munity should be aware of.
The third concept, not entirely independent from the first, is that a published dataset is one
that has been described by a data paper. Data papers correlate with peer review and both kinds
of metadata, but not with features related to the disposition of the data (e.g. open availability or
repository deposit), even though virtually all data paper publishers require repository deposit.
Data papers conferred less trust than any other feature, but only by a small margin: 36% of re-
spondents derive high or complete confidence from a data paper, compared to 44% from suc-
cessful reuse. Respondents regarded data papers as much less valuable than traditional research
papers: 60% would give traditional paper a great deal of weight, but only 10% would value a
data paper that highly. Only 16% had been able to name a data journal at the start of the survey,
and data papers may come to be valued more as awareness spreads; one respondent wrote “I’ve
never heard of this, but it sounds fantastic.” Alternatively, research communities may conclude
that data papers should be valued less. Already, 55% of respondents gave a data paper

significant (or higher) value, and that may ultimately be appropriate. Data papers clearly add
perceived value to a dataset, but not as much as peer review.
Validating published data
Quality control via peer review is integral to traditional scholarly publication so it is no surprise
that, in reference to data publication, the RIN noted “[t]here is, for some, also an implication
that the information has been through a quality control process” [18]. Even in regard to novel
material like data, researchers trust the traditional scholarly publication process: our respon-
dents trusted peer review and use in a research paper more than any other indicators of quality.
However, less than half expected published data to have been used in a published research
paper and only one third expected it to have been peer reviewed. We conclude, with the RIN,
that researchers don’t have a clear idea what quality control to expect from published data. In
this uncertainty, the research and scholarly communication communities are in perfect agree-
ment. How, and how extensively, to assess data quality is the least settled of the many open
questions surrounding data publication, and different initiatives take a variety of approaches,
including collecting user feedback, distinct technical and scientific review, and closely model-
ing literature peer review [32].
Peer review establishes the trustworthiness of dataset and elevates its perceived value more
than any other factor in this survey. Despite one respondent’s remark that “I have never heard
this term applied to a dataset and I don’t know what it means,” expectations of peer review
were more consistent than of publication. Whereas only 68% of respondents selected even the
most popular feature in the question on data publication, 90% agreed that they expect data
peer review to include evaluation of collection and processing methods. In fact, half of the peer
review assessments were selected by more than 68% of respondents.
Unsurprisingly, a majority of respondents expect assessments that require domain expertise,
i.e. that peer review involve review by peers in their field. Assessment of plausibility was linked
with three other assessment that require domain expertise: method evaluation, adequacy of
metadata for replication, and potential novelty/impact. The high (80%) expectation that peer
review of data includes peer review of its documentation/metadata suggests that researchers
are aware of the critical importance of documentation for data reuse and replication. That and
the low (22%) expectation that peer review consider novelty/impact are in line with current
data journal peer review processes and guidelines [32]. However, our survey question focused
on the aspects of a data publication that might be assessed, not the review process, and peer re-
view expectations might be satisfied through any number of pre- or post-publication processes.
We conclude that models of data publication without peer review are unlikely to confuse re-
searchers, but that peer review greatly enhances both reuse and reward. Furthermore, assess-
ment processes that at least meet the expectations of peer review will be critical for data
publications to attain a status at all comparable to that of journal articles.
The idea that “data use in its own right provides a form of review” [43] is frequently express-
ed in the conversation around data publication. Reuse could be documented through citations
from research papers to the dataset or direct feedback from researchers who used the data.
Based on past experiences, we were surprised that successful reuse did not inspire more trust;
both peer review and “basis of a traditional paper” inspired slightly more confidence than
reuse. It is worth nothing that serving as the basis of a research paper by the dataset creator is
itself evidence of successful use, just not by a third party. However, respondents did consider ci-
tations to be the most useful metric for assessing value/impact. This apparent contradiction
could result from evaluating trustworthiness and impact differently or from different concepts
of “successful” reuse and reuse that that results in a citation. The combined value of enhancing

trust and establishing impact makes tracking dataset citations eminently worthwhile, but still
no substitute for peer review.
Credit for publishing data
The scholarly communication community agrees that data should be cited formally in the ref-
erence list [44], but this is rarely actually done [45–47]. In a 1995 survey of 198 papers that
used published social science datasets, 19% cited the dataset with at least the title in the refer-
ence list [45]. A followup 17 years later found that only 17% of papers meeting even this low
standard, showing that practice has not improved [47]. The most common actual approach is
informal citation in the methods or results section of the paper; 30.8% of papers in 1995 and
69.2% in 2012 included the dataset title somewhere in the text. Notwithstanding this dismal
state of practice, researchers agree that the correct approach is formal citation; 95% of respon-
dents to DataONE said that formal citation was a fair condition for data sharing, 87% of astro-
biologists said the same, and 71% of biodiversity researchers said they would like their data to
be cited “in the references like normal publications” [17, 20, 21]. Here too, formal citation was
the most popular response to both how a dataset creator should be credited and how the re-
spondent actually credited data creators. No respondents admitted to citing data informally in
the text. This apparent disconnect between what is observed in the social science literature and
self-reported practice could arise in any of a number or ways: it may be that social science is
not a representative discipline, that occasions when respondents cited data formally are easier
to bring to mind, or that researchers define dataset reuse differently than the authors of the lit-
erature surveys. For instance, a biologist who uses a sequence from GenBank and mentions the
accession number in the methods section of the paper might not think of that activity as data
reuse warranting a formal citation. Beyond notions of credit, formal data citations are useful to
the 71% of respondents to the EAGDA survey who already track use of their datasets “through
details of publications generated using the data” [3]. We conclude that researchers are aware of
the benefits of formal data citation and suggest that data citation efforts focus on implementa-
tion rather than persuasion.
While respondents deemed citation the most useful metric of dataset value, they also at-
tached high value to download counts. These preferences align with the practices reported in
the EAGDA survey, where 43% of respondents tracked downloads of their datasets [3]. In the
present scholarly communication infrastructure, repositories can count downloads much more
easily than citations; citations are preferable, but downloads are the “low hanging fruit” of data
metrics. In comparison to download counts, appreciation of altmetrics (e.g. mentions in social
media or the popular press) was low: only one third of respondents found them even somewhat
useful in assessing impact. Altmetrics for research articles are still being developed, so it is not
surprising that researchers are unsure what they might signify for data. For data publishers,
there is certainly no harm in providing altmetrics– and a majority of respondents did find
them at least slightly useful– but they are unlikely to have much impact in the short term.
Researchers see the time required as the biggest cost to data sharing, but the risk they most
fear is that “data vultures” will strip the data for publications without adequately acknowledg-
ing the creator(s) [19]. To learn how well-founded these fears are, we asked respondents how
satisfied they were with their credit the last time someone published using their data. The ma-
jority felt that the credit was appropriate, but the fraction that felt shortchanged (22%) is too
large to ignore, and we must conclude that this dissatisfaction is a real problem. Whether the
problem is ultimately with the way dataset creators are credited or the way dataset creators ex-
pect to be credited is for research communities to decide. We can say that there was no signifi-
cant difference in how satisfied and dissatisfied respondents thought dataset creators should be

credited, so the variability in satisfaction was most likely driven by variability in credit received
rather than the respondent’s expectation. As data publication takes shape, the problem can be
reduced by solidification of community norms around data use, increased prestige for dataset
creators, and better adoption of formal data citation.
Practical conclusions
The results of this survey offer some practical guidance for data publishers seeking to meet re-
searcher expectations and enhance the value of datasets. Above all else, researchers expect pub-
lished data to be accessible, generally through a database or repository; this fits well with
current practice and, indeed, with the idea of publication at its most fundamental. The research
and scholarly communication communities agree that formal citation is the way to credit a
dataset creator, and a number of steps can be taken to encourage this practice. Data publishers
should enable formal citation (e.g. by assigning persistent identifiers and specifying a preferred
citation format), and article publishers should encourage authors to cite data formally in the
reference list. Data publishers should track and aggregate citations to their datasets to the ex-
tent feasible; at a minimum, they should publicize download counts, which are less valued by
researchers but easier to implement. Data papers enhance dataset value, but much of the value
of a peer-reviewed data paper can be obtained by peer review alone. Peer review is not integral
to data publication for researchers, but it remains the gold standard of both trustworthiness
and prestige. Repositories and databases can make data more useful to both creators and users
by incorporating peer review, whether by managing the process themselves or integrating with
peer-reviewed data journals. While many aspects of data peer review are unresolved, two clear
expectations that should be met are that true peers will supply domain expertise and that evalu-
ation of metadata will play a significant role.
Methods
Ethics statement
All results were drawn from a survey approved by the University of California, Berkeley Com-
mittee for Protection of Human Subjects/Office for the Protection of Human Subjects (proto-
col ID 2013-11-5841). Respondents completed the survey anonymously. Researchers affiliated
with the University of California (UC) could supply an email address for follow-up assistance
with data publication, but neither the fact of affiliation nor any UC-specific information was
used in this analysis.
Survey design and distribution
The survey contained 34 questions in three categories: demographics, data sharing interest and
experience, and data publication perceptions (S1 Text). Demographic questions collected in-
formation on respondent’s country, type of institution, research role, and discipline. Questions
to assess respondent’s existing knowledge of data sharing and publication focused on knowl-
edge of several relevant US governmental policies and an invitation to name data journals.
Data publication perceptions consisted of “mark all that apply” questions concerning defini-
tions of data publication and peer review and Likert scale questions about the value of various
possible features of a data publication. The number of required questions was kept to a mini-
mum. Some questions were displayed dynamically based on previous answers. Consequently, n
varies considerably from question to question.
The survey was administered as a Google Form, officially open from January 22 to February
28 of 2014; two late responses received in March were included in the analysis. Solicitations

were distributed via social media (Twitter, Facebook, Google+), emails to listservs, and a blog
post on Data Pub [32].
Data processing and analysis
Although the topic of the survey is benign and identification would be unlikely to negatively
impact respondents, light anonymization was performed prior to analysis and release of the re-
sponse data. UC affiliation and answers to UC-specific questions were redacted. Respondent
locations were grouped into United States and “other.” Questions that related to US policies
were analyzed based on US respondents only; one questions about the NIH was analyzed based
only on US biologists Fig. 1. Sub-disciplines with fewer than three respondents were re-coded
with the corresponding discipline. Listed data journal names were standardized manually, and
free text answers to other questions were replaced with “other.” Because few questions were re-
quired, “mark all that apply” questions with no reply at all were considered to be skipped.
After anonymization, responses were filtered for analysis. Because the goal of the survey was
to learn about researchers as distinct from the scholarly communication community, we ex-
empted from analysis anyone who self-identified as a librarian or information scientist. To re-
strict the analysis to active researchers only, anyone who affirmed that they had not generated
any data in the last five years was exempted; the 90 who respondents did not answer this ques-
tion were retained. Finally, respondents without at least a Bachelors Degree were filtered out.
In total, 32 respondents were removed before analysis, some by multiple criteria.
Statistical significance was tested using Fisher’s exact test where possible (i.e., for 2x2 tables)
and contingency χ2 in all other cases [48]. A statistical significance cutoff of α = 0.05 was used.
When testing for e.g., effects of discipline or prior experience, each answer choice was tested
separately, then the Bonferroni correction for multiple hypothesis testing was applied to adjust
α for that question; this is a conservative approach that may not detect subtle differences.
Mathematicians were omitted from χ2 significance testing for effects of discipline because their
low n led to unacceptably small expected count numbers. Odds Ratios (ORs) [49] and Fisher’s
exact test p-values were used to assess the relationships between items depicted in Fig. 5; to en-
able meaningful comparison, all ORs were calculated in the direction that yielded a value  1.
The robustness of all significant results was confirmed using a jackknife procedure in which
the test was repeated systematically with each respondent removed; in no cases did the absence
of a single respondent raise the p-value above the designated significance threshold. Error bars
represent 95% basic bootstrap confidence intervals (10,000 resamples) of the mean response in
Fig. 5 and the percentage of positive responses in all other figures. To facilitate comparison, χ2
effects were measured as Cramér’s V (FC) [50].
Analysis was performed using IPython [51], Pandas [52], and Numpy [53]. Graphs were
prepared using matplotlib [54] and formatted with Adobe Illustrator. Statistical power calcula-
tions were performed using GPower 3.1 [55]. An IPython notebook containing the code used
for data analysis is available at Zenodo [56].
