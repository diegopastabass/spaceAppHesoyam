Abstract
Anhydrobiotic chironomid larvae can withstand prolonged complete desiccation as well as other external stresses including
ionizing radiation. To understand the cross-tolerance mechanism, we have analyzed the structural changes in the nuclear
DNA using transmission electron microscopy and DNA comet assays in relation to anhydrobiosis and radiation. We found
that dehydration causes alterations in chromatin structure and a severe fragmentation of nuclear DNA in the cells of the
larvae despite successful anhydrobiosis. Furthermore, while the larvae had restored physiological activity within an hour
following rehydration, nuclear DNA restoration typically took 72 to 96 h. The DNA fragmentation level and the recovery of
DNA integrity in the rehydrated larvae after anhydrobiosis were similar to those of hydrated larvae irradiated with 70 Gy of
high-linear energy transfer (LET) ions (4He). In contrast, low-LET radiation (gamma-rays) of the same dose caused less initial
damage to the larvae, and DNA was completely repaired within within 24 h. The expression of genes encoding the DNA
repair enzymes occurred upon entering anhydrobiosis and exposure to high- and low-LET radiations, indicative of DNA
damage that includes double-strand breaks and their subsequent repair. The expression of antioxidant enzymes-coding
genes was also elevated in the anhydrobiotic and the gamma-ray-irradiated larvae that probably functions to reduce the
negative effect of reactive oxygen species upon exposure to these stresses. Indeed the mature antioxidant proteins
accumulated in the dry larvae and the total activity of antioxidants increased by a 3–4 fold in association with anhydrobiosis.
We conclude that one of the factors explaining the relationship between radioresistance and the ability to undergo
anhydrobiosis in the sleeping chironomid could be an adaptation to desiccation-inflicted nuclear DNA damage. There were
also similarities in the molecular response of the larvae to damage caused by desiccation and ionizing radiation.

Introduction
Extreme environments force organisms to develop or adopt
effective mechanisms of cellular and molecular protection. Anhy-
drobiosis, the ability of organisms to survive in the dry state, is one of
the most advanced strategies among hypometabolic states [1,2].
While the cells of other organisms subjected to dehydration exhibit
massive damage to their organelles and membranes, anhydrobiotic
organisms can effectively counteract the negative effects of water
deprivation [3,4,5]. Although the molecular mechanisms underpin-
ning anhydrobiosis are not yet completely understood, it is generally
accepted that they involve two broad functions: effective preserva-
tion of cells and biomolecules under dry conditions; and recovery
and alleviation of the negative effects, both direct and indirect, of
water loss on biomolecules upon post dry-state rehydration [3,6].
In addition, being anhydrobiotic confers cross-tolerance to
various other extreme environmental stressors, including different
types of radiation [7,8,9,10,11,12,13]. It has long been recognized
that this is possibly due to the protective mechanisms associated
with anhydrobiosis, including the physical protection (i.e. free
radical partial scavenging and radiation shielding) of cells by
sugars,
LEA proteins
and
other protectants
against
direct
irradiation or its side effects [7,14,15,16,17,18]. Indeed, at least
for microorganisms and cultured cells, it has been shown that
coating with sugars, such as trehalose, increases survival after long-
term exposure to UV and ionizing irradiation [19,20,21].
The enhanced protection and repair of DNA might also be
responsible for the cross-tolerance to ionizing radiation [2,7,10,13,
22,23]. In plant seeds and desiccation-resistant bacteria, repair
of fragmented DNA is an indispensable step in revival after

anhydrobiosis [24,25,26]. In multicellular animals, the effect of
anhydrobiosis on DNA is controversial. While prolonged dehy-
dration affects the nucleic acids of anhydrobionts and plant seeds
in a duration-dependent manner, anhydrobiosis does not cause
any serious DNA damage in the anhydrobiotic nematodes,
crustaceans and tardigrades with the exception of bdelloid rotifers
in which the DNA fragmentation effect of desiccation is suggested
to occur [8,22,27,28,29,30].
The sleeping chironomid Polypedilum vanderplanki, which inhabit
the semi-arid area in Africa, is the only insect with the ability to
resist almost complete dehydration during its larval stage and to
reversibly revive within an hour of re-hydration [31]. Since the
artificial rearing method for this species was established [31], a
significant progress has been made to understand its structural
protective mechanisms during anhydrobiosis at cellular and
molecular levels. During dehydration, trehalose and LEA proteins
increase in quantity [31,32,33], replacing the water in cells and
forming glasses to preserve the cell structure in the dry state [34].
Concurrently, the expression of genes encoding heat shock
proteins (i.e., chaperones) is increased, resulting in the protection
of other proteins from denaturation caused by dehydration [35].
In a series of irradiation studies [7,16,36], it has been
demonstrated that dried larvae show higher tolerance to both
high-LET (directly causing DNA breaks) and low-LET (causing
increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the irradiated tissues)
irradiation, measured by short-term survival compared with
physiologically active larvae. Furthermore, this enhanced radiation
tolerance is observed in both desiccating larvae, and larvae
immediately after rehydration [16], suggesting that radiotolerance
mechanisms are in place during both the induction and the
recovery phase of anhydrobiosis.
The aim of the present study is to evaluate and compare the effects
of anhydrobiosis, gamma-ray and heavy-ion irradiation on the
nuclear DNA and the gene expression of the larvae of P. vanderplanki.
We demonstrate that larval DNA becomes fragmented both upon
anhydrobiosis and irradiation, which is later repaired through
rehydration or recovery from irradiation. Thus, the DNA repair
ability associated with anhydrobiotic potential seems to correlate
with radiotolerance of the chironomid larvae. In addition, analyses of
gene expression and antioxidant activity suggest the importance of
ROS removal and DNA repair systems to protect biomolecules from
damages associated with water loss and gamma-rays.
Results
DNA fragmentation caused by irradiation and
anhydrobiosis
DNA breaks in fat body cells have been visualized and
quantified using a comet assay method up to 168 h after exposure
of the larvae to 70 Gy from two types of radiation (gamma-rays
and heavy ions) and also during the recovery of dry larvae after re-
hydration (Fig. 1A). Although some cells from non-irradiated
hydrated larvae exhibited detectable levels of DNA fragmentation,
probably reflecting naturally occurring breakage during the cell
cycle or effects of experimental procedures, the mean level of
background DNA fragmentation (% of DNA in the tail of a comet)
in a pool of these control cells never exceeded 5–7% (Fig. 1B).
Irradiated larvae showed significantly higher levels of DNA
fragmentation ranging from 15% to 50% depending on the type of
radiation used (Fig. 1A, B). Comparative analysis of DNA recovery
kinetics shows that it took up to 168 h for the larvae irradiated
with heavy ions to recover nuclear DNA integrity to the control
baseline level, whereas DNA of gamma-ray irradiated larvae was
repaired within 24 h (Fig. 1A, B).
Non-irradiated dried larvae after rehydration also contained
cells with severely damaged DNA, with a level of fragmentation
comparable to the larvae exposed to 70 Gy 4He ions. In the
anhydrobiotic larvae, however, DNA damage decreased to the
background level within 96 h after rehydration, much quicker
than in
4He ion-irradiated samples. While entering into the
anhydrobiotic state always caused DNA damage in the larvae, no
further significant increase in the level of nuclear DNA damage
was found, even when the dry larvae were kept at room
temperature for 14 months.
In both 4He ion-irradiated and post-anhydrobiosis larvae, no
significant recovery of DNA was observed within 24 h (Fig. 1B).
Despite this prolonged and severe fragmentation of DNA however,
no large scale cell death was observed in either group.
Ultrastructure of cells of hydrated and dry larvae
Two types of cells in dry larvae were used for analysis of the
state of chromatin: one comprises small cells with large nuclei
occupying more than 50% of the total cell area and which form
compact clusters (Fig. 2A, B), and the other consists of large cells
with dense cytoplasm and which are abundant in the body
(Fig. 2C, D). The latter category represents fat body cells and the
former might be non-differentiated cells of hematopoietic organs
or imaginal pads. These cells in fat body of the larvae have been
shown earlier to be capable of surviving complete desiccation even
if dissected from the larvae, which makes this cell type a
convenient model for studies of anhydrobiosis [37,38].
The clustered, non-differentiated cells of dehydrated and
hydrated larvae showed no apparent difference in the size ratio
of the nucleus to the cytoplasm. However, entry into anhydrobiosis
resulted in deformation of the nuclear shape, and the formation of
multiple invaginations (Fig. 2A, arrows), most probably reflecting
general shrinkage of the cells upon dehydration and replacement
of water with trehalose and other protectants (Fig. 2A, B). In fat
body cells, in contrast, the total area of cytoplasm in anhydrobiotic
larvae greatly decreased in comparison to the hydrated condition
(Fig. 2D), while the nuclear shape and size did not exhibit obvious
changes (Fig. 2C, D).
In both cell types, the nuclei of hydrated cells contained
osmiophilic and widely dispersed chromatin (n, Fig. 2B, D).
However, the nucleoplasm, particularly the dispersed chromatin,
exhibited clear segregation and condensation patterns in dry cells
(Fig. 2A, C). In Polypedilum larvae, even after 14 months of dry
preservation, no further differences related to the duration of
anhydrobiosis in morphology of cells and organelles were
observed. The larvae which have been left for at least 24 h
following complete rehydration still exhibited the condensation of
chromatin in its nuclei, similar to that of larvae in the dry state.
Antioxidant activity during anhydrobiosis cycle in the larvae
We observed an initial elevation of total antioxidant activity
(ROS-scavenging capacity) in the larvae subjected to dehydration
for 16 h (D-16 h stage), which reached its maximum in completely
dehydrated larvae at D-48 h (3–4 fold increase compared with
unstressed wet larvae) (Fig. 3). Upon rehydration, high level of
total antioxidant activity continued to be observable in the larvae
for the first 12 h minimum (R-12 h), and was followed by the
reduction to the same level as the non-stressed larvae at R-24 h.
Identifying the presence of mature glutathione
peroxidase protein in desiccated larvae
In order to isolate the essence of the antioxidant activity, a
candidate spot was identified on 2D gel prepared using total protein

crude from desiccated larvae (Fig. 4). The amino-acid sequence of
the protein’s N-terminus was found to be TELKQGNPDQ, which
corresponds to the amino acids 30–39 of the protein product of
glutathione peroxidase coding gene (HQ331115) and represents a
mature enzyme (lacking signal peptide). No corresponding spot was
detectable on the 2D electrophoresis gel prepared from hydrated
active larvae thus we concluded that mature glutathione peroxidase
accumulated in the anhydrobiotic larvae (Fig. 4, left panel).

elimination system (catalase (HM062769), Cu/Zn-superoxide
dismutase (HM062770) and glutathione peroxidase (HQ331115))

larvae entering anhydrobiosis [32,39]. Quantitative RT-PCR
showed a high level of expression for all of these genes in the
drying larvae by the D-8h stage, reaching a peak of an 8–10 fold
increase of mRNA level at the D-24h and D-48h stages (Fig. 5A).
During rehydration, there was no additional increase in the
expression of these genes, but differences in their expression
profiles were apparent: for the SOD encoding gene (Sod), mRNA
levels immediately fell to control levels seen in hydrated larvae and
maintained these levels throughout all stages of rehydration (R-1h
to R-48h), while the expression of both catalase (Cat) and
peroxidase (Per) encoding genes returned to the level of control
hydrated larvae only at stage R-12h (Fig. 5A). The two types of
radiation (4He ions and gamma-rays) resulted in different
expression profiles of antioxidant-encoding genes. While no
significant changes in expression of any of the three genes were

observed in 4He-irradiated larvae (Fig. 5B), gamma-ray irradiation
resulted in an increased expression of all three genes within the
first few hours after irradiation before control levels were resumed
(Fig. 5C).
DNA repair enzymes.
We have analyzed the expression of
two genes involved in DNA damage recognition and repair: Rad23
(HM062772), whose protein plays a central role in proteosomal
degradation of misfolded proteins but is also involved in both
DNA excision repair and different types of DNA damage
recognition
[40];
and
Rad51
(HM062773),
whose
protein
participates in a common DNA damage response pathway
associated with the activation of homologous recombination and
double-strand break (DSB) repair [41].
An increase in Rad23 expression is observed in both
4He-
irradiated and gamma-ray irradiated larvae (Fig. 5E, F). Heavy-
ion irradiation resulted in an 8-fold increase of the Rad23 mRNA
expression in the larvae within an hour of irradiation, and the
increased level of expression was maintained for at least 48 h
(Fig. 5E). A transient up-regulation of Rad23 was detectable in the
larvae 3 h after gamma-ray irradiation, with mRNA levels
decreasing to the control level during the next 24 h (Fig. 5F).
Significant up-regulation of the Rad23 gene was also found in
dehydrating larvae beginning at the D-8h stage, and reaching a
maximum value of 7-8-fold up-regulation at D-16h and -24h.
Little or no expression of the gene was detected immediately after
rehydration, but within a few hours (R-3h) the level of mRNA
returned to the average control value (Fig. 5D).
Expression of the Rad51 gene was up-regulated by more than
25-fold in the larvae within 1 h following heavy-ion irradiation
and was maintained at a high level for at least 48 h (Fig. 5E).
Similarly, an increase in Rad51 mRNA level was induced by
gamma-rays by 3 h after irradiation and remained high (more
than 20-fold higher compared to control hydrated larvae) until at
least the 12 h stage before returning to the control levels (Fig. 5F).
Rad51 gene expression showed a significant increase during
anhydrobiosis, but unlike Rad23, the increase in Rad51 gene
expression did not begin until rehydration. Maximal expression of
Rad51 was observed in the larvae after 3 h of rehydration following
which expression gradually decreases and finally returns to a level
comparable to control wet larvae at the R-48h stage (Fig. 5D).

Discussion
Anhydrobiotic chironomid larvae can withstand an exposure to
various external stresses, including high dose radiation [2,7,36,42].
The molecular mechanisms which allow the chironomid larvae to
survive an almost complete dehydration share some common
features with those of other anhydrobionts. These are: (i) the
replacement of structural water with compatible solutes such as
disaccharides; (ii) the formation of stable glasses from highly
hydrophilic
proteins
which
prevent
the
biomolecules
from
irreversible aggregation [1,5,12,21,43]. However, water replace-
ment and vitrification alone do not fully explain the cross-
tolerance to different types of ionizing radiation. In the present
study, we demonstrated that P. vanderplanki also has a remarkable
resilience against DNA breaks caused by desiccation and two types
of radiation.
We found that despite the presence of trehalose and other
protectants associated with anhydrobiosis [32,34], there were
severe damages to nuclear DNA in the cells of anhydrobiotic
larvae (Fig. 2). Simultaneously, antioxidant activity increased upon

dehydration (Fig. 3), which is probably attributed to the elevation
of ROS levels in the larvae. As suggested for other anhydrobionts
by several authors [3,44], the ROS generated during dehydration
of cells may be the major cause of DNA fragmentation, and this is
also likely to be true for P. vanderplanki. Slow dehydration provides
an optimal condition to enter anhydrobiosis successfully [33], thus,
in this case larvae are subjected to prolonged periods of
‘‘intermediate’’ water concentrations. However, we suppose that
all
metabolic
processes,
including
respiration,
nucleic
acid
synthesis and accumulation of protectants need to take place
continuously until the intracellular matrix vitrifies [45,46]. This
state of water deficit is dangerous for the cells as it is associated
with over-production of ROS [3,17,44].
An initial increase in the expression of genes involved in the
oxidative stress response was observed in the desiccated larvae,
followed by the elevation of total oxidants activity and the
accumulation of mature antioxidants. These changes are likely to
be due to an increase in ROS concentration triggered by the onset
of desiccation (Fig. 3; Fig. 5A; Fig. 4). The antioxidants-coding
genes were induced by low-LET (gamma-rays) radiation, which
causes excessive ROS production, but not by high-LET radiation,
which mainly exerts direct effects on biomolecules (Fig. 5 B, C). A
gradual decrease of both the expression of these genes and the
antioxidant activity in rehydrated larvae (Fig. 5A) would suggest that
the consequences of ROS activity are neutralized, at least at the
early stage of rehydration by the antioxidants synthesized before
entering the dry state. This stays in agreement with the results from
the analysis of EST databases prepared from anhydrobiotic larvae,
which showed that the elevation in the expression of other
antioxidants and heat shock protein-coding genes is tightly linked
with anhydrobiosis in the larva [35,39]. This accumulation of
antioxidants, which maintains its activity even in the dry larvae
might be one of the key factors ensuring the survival of P. vanderplanki
in dry state, as it does in anhydrobiosis-capable cyanobacteria, plant
seeds, resurrection plant tissues and nematodes [47,48].
Nevertheless, the changes in chromatin ultrastructure (Fig. 2)
and the occurrence of DNA breaks in the dried larvae (Fig. 1)
suggest that, despite the activation of ROS-elimination systems
(Fig. 3), the oxidative stress due to desiccation is not completely
neutralized. Similar patterns of nuclei were observed in the fat
body cells of the gall fly Eufrosta after high pressure freezing [49],
and segregation of chromatin was taken to indicate DNA damage
[50,51,52]. Furthermore, the presence of DNA breaks, and not
that of ROS, is likely to be responsible for the induction of genes
(Rad23 and Rad51) directly involved in different types of DNA
repair, as both genes were up-regulated by desiccation and both
high- and low-LET radiation (Fig. 4D, E, F).
Although the process leading to the general recovery of nuclear
DNA integrity in rehydrated larvae is still unclear, there are at
least two possibilities: (i) fragmented DNA is restored by DNA
repair systems; or (ii) damaged cells are eliminated by apoptosis
while the remaining intact cells proliferate. The latter hypothesis
seems less plausible, since we found continuous and gradual
decrease in ‘‘comet tails’’ of damaged cells, suggesting that DNA
reparation is taking place in either the rehydrated or the irradiated
larvae (Fig. 2). The occurrence of rapid DNA repair that has been
suggested by many authors to be a specific feature of anhydro-
biotic organisms [1,8,10,22,29,53] was not observed in the cells we
studied. Instead, it took more than 48 h to complete DNA
recovery in the larvae reviving after anhydrobiosis and even longer
in larvae irradiated with 4He ions (Fig. 1). Typically, the repair of
DSB in living cells takes less than 24 h and, in many cases, excess
DNA damage in higher eukaryotes, including insects, triggers
necrotic or apoptotic processes [54,55,56]. We still do not know
how the larvae prevent cells with damaged DNA from committing
apoptosis over such an extended period of time. Further
cytological and biochemical studies must be carried out to resolve
this issue since some observations suggest that there might be a
specific regulation of apoptosis in anhydrobionts [57,58,59].
Recent studies have focused on survival rates after anhydrobiosis
and showed that not all larvae are able to revive from the dry state;
several physiological factors, including the rate of dehydration,
determine the viability of the anhydrobiotic larvae [33]. Clearly
water replacement and vitrification are indispensable for successful

induction of anhydrobiosis [5,34]. Nevertheless, our present data
suggest that such protective mechanisms are insufficient for the
maintenance of structural integrity of DNA in dry cells, and DNA
repair after rehydration is another key for successful anhydrobiosis.
Concerning this point, genetic adaptations to anhydrobiosis in the
sleeping chironomid show some functional analogies with those of
the radiotolerant bacteria Deinococcus radiodurans [23,60], in which
both desiccation and irradiation cause severe DNA damage,
followed by prolonged DNA recovery period associated with delay
in cell cycle (while doubling time under normal conditions is 1.5–
3 h) [23,60]. At the same time there are clear differences in these
two phenomena, i.e., DNA reparation machinery and oxidative
stress-response are different in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, genome
organization in insects is much more complex and there is cell and
tissue specification [61,62,63,64]. In addition, recent studies have
suggested that DNA breaks take place in other anhydrobionts such
as bdelloid rotifers [30,65]. Therefore, this convergent character-
istics, as well as molecular protection by glasses, must be taken into
account for future development of biotechnology, i.e., dried cell
preservation.
The anhydrobiotic chironomid larvae presumably experience
nuclear DNA fragmentation with each cycle of desiccation and
rehydration, and must have overcome this threat efficiently to
survive the drought season. It is likely that an initial increase in the
expression of genes coding for antioxidants and DNA repair
enzymes as well as the increase in antioxidant activity are rather
typical

[66,67,68,69]. During the course of evolution, P. vanderplanki might
have intensified this response, concomitantly with the acquisition of
an ability to preserve the viability of cells beyond the dehydration
threshold at which other insects would die. This anhydrobiosis-
related evolution of augmented antioxidant protective mechanisms
and DNA repair machinery is also most likely responsible for the
remarkable cross-resistance of P. vanderplanki larvae in both dry and
hydrated forms to the different types of ionizing radiation.
Materials and Methods
Insect rearing
P. vanderplanki were reared on a 1% agar diet containing 2%
commercial milk under controlled light (13 h light: 11 h dark) and
temperature (27–28uC) conditions according to previous report
[31]. Final instar larvae of approximately 1 mg wet body weight
were used for all experiments. The procedure of desiccation to
induce anhydrobiosis has been described [70]. Briefly, the larvae
were placed on filter paper with 0.44 ml of distilled water in a glass
Petri dish (diameter 65 mm, height 20 mm), which was set in a
desiccator (20620620 cm) with 1 kg of silica gel. For rehydration,
dry larvae were placed in dishes with 27–28uC distilled water.
Larvae for RNA expression analysis and antioxidants activity assay
were sampled according to the time (in hours) passed from the
beginning of desiccation (D) and rehydration (R), correspondingly.
Irradiation
For gamma-ray irradiation, approximately 100 hydrated larvae
were placed in a plastic vial (Sumilon MS-4503, Sumitomo
Bakelite Co., Tokyo, Japan) with 1 ml water. The samples were
irradiated with 70 Gy of gamma-rays from a 60Co source at 60
Gy/min [16]; 70 Gy is the half-inhibition gamma-ray dose for
adult emergence in hydrated larvae [16].
For heavy-ion irradiation, hydrated larvae were placed on the
bottom of a plastic Petri dish (diameter 50 mm, height 10 mm).
The dish was covered with polyimide film and sealed with
Parafilm (Alcan Packaging, Chicago, IL) to avoid drying. The
samples were exposed to 70 Gy of a 50 MeV 4He (LET‘ = 16.2
keV/mm) ion beam delivered from the azimuthally varying-field
(AVF) cyclotron at the Takasaki Ion accelerators for Advanced
Radiation Application (TIARA) facility of the Japan Atomic
Energy Agency (JAEA) [16,36].
Control samples were sham irradiated and manipulated in
parallel with the test samples. Both irradiated and non-irradiated
larvae were supplied with distilled water.
Source of clones
All clones of target genes used in this study were obtained by
analysis of the Pv-EST database [32,39]. The full-length cDNAs
were subcloned into pCR4Blunt-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Carls-
bad, CA) and the resulting plasmids were used as templates for the
calibration controls of real-time PCR reactions. DNA sequences
were analyzed with Vector NTI 10.3 software (Invitrogen).
Quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA from hydrated, dehydrating, rehydrated, and
irradiated larvae was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen) and the
RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and reverse
transcribed using Ready-To-GoTM T-Prime First-Strand Kit (GE
Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Piscataway, NJ). The RNA samples from
dehydrating and rehydrating larvae were named ‘‘D’’ and ‘‘R’’,
respectively, and numbers correspond to the hours of treatment.
Real-time PCR was performed using a LightCycler H 2.0 Real-
Time PCR apparatus (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) with
SYBRH Green PCR Master Mix (TaKaRa, Ohtsu, Japan).
Amplifications were performed using 16SYBR Green PCR mix
(TaKaRa) and 10 pmol of each primer. P. vanderplanki EF1-alpha
cDNA served as an internal standard for data normalization and
quantification. The expression of each gene was tested in triplicate
in each of three biologically independent experiments. The cycling
conditions were: 15 min activation at 95uC, 45 cycles of 10 s at
95uC, 20 s at 60uC, 25 s at 72uC. Melting curves from 60uC to 99uC,
rising by 1uC at each step, and pausing 5 s after each step, and the
accompanying software were used for qPCR data normalization
and quantification. The genes, GenBank accession numbers,
amplicon sizes and primers are shown in Table S1.
Antioxidant activity (ROS-scavenging) assay
The antioxidant activity was investigated in the larvae during
dehydration or rehydration, using an antioxidant activity assay kit
(AB-2970 CLETA-S; Atto, Tokyo, Japan). Briefly, hypoxanthine-
xanthine oxidase systems were used as the source of ROS.
Chemiluminescence generation by the reaction between superoxide
generator and a luminous substance, MPEC, and its decay in the
presence of the crude from a homogenized single larva with assay
buffer was measured. Relative antioxidant-scavenging capacity in a
single larva was calculated according to manufacturer’s manual.
2D electrophoresis, image analysis, and protein
sequencing
Active (wet) and desiccated (dry) larvae were homogenized in T-
PER lysis buffer (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL) with
Complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Basel, Switzerland).
Obtained crude protein samples (100 mg) were cleaned by 2-D
Clean Up kit (GE Healthcare Bioscience), and applied to 11 cm
IPG strips (pH 4–7, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) for passive overnight
rehydration according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The IPG
strips
were
then
subjected
to
isoelectric
focusing
using
a
PROTEAN IEF Cell (Bio-Rad). Focusing was performed for
38,000 V-hour. After isoelectric focusing, the IPG strips were

equilibrated for 15 min in equilibration buffer I [6 M urea, 2%
(w/v) SDS, 0.05 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 20% (v/v) glycerol and 2%
(w/v) dithiothreitol (DTT)] followed by 15 min in buffer II (same
as buffer I but containing 2.5% iodoacetamide instead of DTT).
For the second dimension, IPG strips were placed across a 17%
acrylamide Gel for PROTEAN II D xi cell (Bio-Rad), then
overlayed with agarose. Electrophoresis was run with a constant
voltage, 140V, for 2 h in Tris-glycine buffer (25 mM Tris,
192 mM glycine, 0.1c SDS. pH 8.3). Gels were stained with
Coomassie brilliant blue (CBB) G-250 solution for 30 min and
washed in water and further distained by acetic acid-methanol
solution two times, 30 min each. To obtain image files, stained gels
were scanned with a high-resolution scanner (GT-X800, Epson,
Tokyo, Japan). Protein spots were matched automatically by 2D
Platinum (GE Healthcare). Spot intensities were normalized to
make the total density in each gel image equal, and analysis was
performed using quantitative and qualitative modes. A spot was
detected when its intensity was X?-fold or more above the
background. The gels were blotted to PVDF membrane and
stained with CBB R-250 and after destaining, the selected protein
bands were cut out and used directly for sequencing by the Edman
degradation method using a HP 241 Protein Sequencer according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Comet Assay
Alkaline electrophoresis was performed using the CometAs-
sayTM Kit (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD). Larvae were dissected
and the fat body was extracted. Fat body cells were mixed with
95 ml of 1% low melting point agarose and spread on two slides
previously coated with 1.5% normal agarose. After solidification
by cooling, the slides were immersed in fresh lysis solution plus
10% DMSO for at least 45 min. The slides were incubated in
alkaline buffer solution (300 mM NaOH and 1 mM EDTA,
pH 12.6) for 25 min. The cells were subjected to electrophoresis
for 25 min at 300 mA and 25 V, and then neutralized with
400 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, in three successive washes of 5 min
each. The DNA was then stained with ethidium bromide (2 mg/
ml). Images of 100 randomly selected cells (from each of three
replicate slides) were analyzed from each individual. Occasional
dead cells, overlapping cells and cells on the edge of gels were
avoided. Percentages of DNA in a comet ‘‘head’’ (intact DNA) and
comet ‘‘tail’’ (damaged fragmented DNA) were determined by
CometScore PC software (TriTek Corp, Sumerduck, VA).
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
Dried and hydrated larvae were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in
50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 for 2 h at 4uC. The tissues were
post-fixed in 2% osmium tetroxide in the same buffer for 1 h at
4uC. Dehydration of the tissues was conducted using an ethanol
series of increasing concentration. Subsequently, the tissue pieces
were embedded in a mixture of epoxy resins and were allowed to
polymerize in a thermostat. The sections were contrasted by Na-
uranyl acetate and Pb-citrate and observed with a JEM 100CX
transmission
electron
microscope
using
the
manufacturer’s
instructions. All cells and tissues of the larvae were identified
according to their ultrastructure [71].
Statistical analysis
Results of gene expression and the level of DNA damage are
reported as means 695% CI (confidence index, with P,0.05).
The statistical evaluation was performed using a two-tailed
Student t-test (Prism version 5, GraphPad Software, San Diego,
CA).
