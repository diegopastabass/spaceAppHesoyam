Abstract
Human leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G) is involved in regulating T-cell responses through its interaction with inhibitory
receptors belonging to the immunoglobulin-like transcript family (ILT). In this context, we investigated the pathways
involved in the control of cell-cycle entry of T cells following HLA-G interaction with its inhibitory receptor. We show that
HLA-G acts through its interaction with the LILRB1 receptor expressed on T lymphocytes. Both HLA-G and LILRB1 antibodies
block the inhibitory effect of HLA-G and restore T-cell proliferation. The interaction of HLA-G with T lymphocytes is
associated with phosphorylation of SHP-2 phosphatase, but not SHP-1. In addition, in activated T cells, their incubation with
HLA-G is not associated with a decrease in the TCR or CD28 downstream pathways, but is associated with
dephosphorylation of the mTOR molecule and p70S6K. In contrast, Akt, which acts upstream of mTOR, is not affected
by HLA-G. The inhibition of SHP-2 by NSC-87877(5 mM), a chemical inhibitor of SHP-2, or the use of siRNA, abrogates
dephosphorylation of mTOR and impairs the overexpression of p27kip in the presence of HLA-G. Together, these results
indicate that HLA-G is associated with activation of phosphatase SHP-2, which inhibits the mTOR pathway and favors the
inhibition of the cell-cycle entry of human-activated T cells.

Introduction
Human leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G) participates in graft
tolerance and inhibits proliferation of allogenic T cells. HLA-G is
a non-classical MHC class I molecule with a limited polymor-
phism and has restricted tissue distribution: it is only expressed in
physiological conditions in medullary thymic epithelial cells [1], in
the cornea [2], and in extra-embryonic tissues. During pregnancy,
HLA-G is expressed on the cytotrophoblast and is believed to
inhibit maternal NK cell cytotoxicity, thus allowing development
of the embryo [3]. During human-organ transplantation, HLA-G
expression correlates with improved allograft acceptance [4–7] in
cardiac, lung, combined liver–kidney, or kidney transplantations.
In vitro, HLA-G modulates the function of several immune
effectors: it acts on natural killer cells (NK) by inhibiting their
cytotoxicity [8–10] and their transendothelial-migration properties
[11]. HLA-G also inhibits antigen-specific CD8+ T cell cytolytic
function [12,13], interacts with CD4 T cells and dendritic cells
(DC), which are involved in the initiation of the CD4-cell
activation cascade during the alloimmune response and favor
the expansion of regulatory T cells [14]. HLA-G suppresses CD4+
T cell proliferation in response to allogeneic stimulation [15–17]
and promotes (Th2)-type responses. It also inhibits DC maturation
[18,19], thus increasing allogeneic skin-graft survival.
The inhibitory mechanism of HLA-G on activated T cells
remains controversial. HLA-G has been demonstrated to induced
apoptosis of T cells activated by phytohemagglutinin (PHA) [20]
and a fraction of PHA-activated CD8 cells through the Fas
pathway, leading to activation of caspases [13,21]. In contrast, we
have observed that T cells activated through engagement of their
T-cell receptor (TCR) are inhibited by HLA-G, but do not
undergo apoptosis. This process is associated with inhibition of
cell-cycle entry.
HLA-G receptors on immune cells belong to the killer
immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) [22] and immunoglobulin-
like transcript (ILT) families [23,24]. LILRB1 is mostly expressed
on NK cells, and is also expressed intracellularly by most CD4 and
CD8 T cells, and by a significant fraction at their surface [25],
whereas LILRB4 is expressed on dendritic cells. This suggests that
HLA-G can regulate their functions through its interaction with
these receptors. In vitro, we have shown that the inhibitory properties
of HLA-G depend on its interaction with LILRB1 at the cell surface
of lymphocytes whereas the regulatory effect of HLA-G on DC is
mediated by LILRB2 and LILRB1. CD85j (LILRB1) is a 110-kDa
surface glycoprotein detected on the surface of NK and T-cell
subsets, B cells, dendritic cells, and monocytes [1,2]. CD85j includes
four Ig-like C2 domains in its extracellular region, which interact
with the alpha domain of HLA-G and with UL18, a human
cytomegalovirus (HCMV) protein homologous to HLA class I
molecules [26,27]. Its intracellular domain contains four ITIM-like
sequences [4] that have been demonstrated in Jurkat cells to interact
with phosphatase SHP-1 and thereby inhibit the phosphorylation of
MAP kinases [28]. In addition, crosslinking of LILRB1 is associated
with dephosphorylation of several proteins activated downstream of

the FccR-dependant pathway in monocytes, and leads to the
hypothesis that a phosphatase is activated to inhibit T-cell activation
[29]. In DC, HLA-G has been demonstrated to activate SHP-2
through its interaction with LILRB4 and thereby limit the
activation of DC.
In this report, we have analyzed the pathways affected during
the incubation of HLA-G with activated T cells. We show that
HLA-G, by interacting with CD85j, does not activate SHP-1 but
activates another phosphatase, SHP-2, and inhibits the mTOR
pathway.
Materials and Methods
Cell culture
Peripheral blood leukocytes were isolated from blood-bank
leukophoresis packs obtained from healthy volunteers (EFS, Saint
Louis Hospital, France). After Ficoll-Isopaque density (Eurobio)
gradient centrifugation, adherent cells were removed by incubat-
ing cells on plastic dishes. T cells were stimulated for 3 days with
0.25 mg/ml OKT3 and 100 U/ml IL-2 in RPMI 1640 medium
with 10% decomplemented fetal bovine serum (FBS).
Proliferation assays
Proliferation responses were evaluated by culturing 105 T
lymphocytes in the presence of 56104 M8 cells pretreated with
mitomycin in 0.150 ml of complete medium, or by directly
activating T lymphocytes with OKT3 and IL-2, in 96-well flat-
bottom plates.
Cultures were pulsed with 1 mCi [3H]thymidine (Amersham,
San Francisco, CA) on day 3 or 5, and harvested 18 h later. The
dry filters were counted in a beta counter with scintillation fluid.
Results are given as mean values of triplicate cultures.
Cell lines
The HLA class I-positive M8 melanoma cell line was kindly
provided by F. Jotereau (INSERM U211, Nantes, France) and was
transfected with full-length HLA-G5 cDNA (without the trans-
membrane sequence) (M8-HLA-G5) subcloned in vector pcDNA
(Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Stable cell lines were selected with
geneticin 418 (0.5 mg/ml) (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) in
complete medium as previously described [8,30]. The M8-HLA-
G5 transfectant and control cells (M8 melanoma transfected with
the vector alone) (M8-pcDNA) were used, respectively, as positive
and negative controls [31]. HELA cells were purchased from
ATCC.
Reagents and antibodies
Antibodies against ILT-2 (sc-20065), SHP-2 (sc-280), p27kip (sc-
527), p-p70S6 kinase (Thr421/Ser424)-R and HLA-G (4H84
mAb) (Figure S1) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.
Phospho-mTOR (Ser2448), phospho-SHP-2(Tyr542), phosphor-
p44/42MAPK (ERK1/2) (Thr2002/Tyr204) (197G2), and phos-
pho-Akt (Ser473) were obtained from Cell Signaling. Anti-actin
(A2668) was obtained from Sigma Aldrich, and anti-human
CD247 (CD3jchain) was purchased from BD Pharmingen.
The monoclonal antibody to HLA-G (87G) was purchased from
EXBIO (Czech Republic).
SHP-1 was obtained from Exalpha Biologicals, and phospho-
SHP-1 (phosphor Y536) from Abcam.
For
western-blot
analysis,
immunoreactive
proteins
were
visualized with HRP-coupled goat anti-mouse IgG (Amersham
Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK) or HRP-conjugated sheep
anti-rabbit IgG (Biotest, BUC, France) using an ECL detection
system (ECL kit, Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK).
Anti-CD3 mAb (OKT3) was obtained from Orthoclone. For
immunofluorescence, phycoerythrine-coupled donkey anti-mouse
IgG and fluorescein-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG were purchased
from Jackson ImmunoResearch.
HLA-G5 production by M8 melanoma cell lines and
immune-purification of HLA-G with magnetic beads
Recombinant HLA-G5 protein was produced in a HLA class I-
positive M8 melanoma cell line transfected with HLA-G5 cDNA.
Supernatant from M8-HLA-G5 cells was used as a source of HLA-
G5 and was filtered (0.22 mm) before HLA-G5 could be
immunopurified with magnetic beads. The beads were coated
covalently on their surfaces with anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Adembeads
goat
anti-mouse
antibodies,
Ademtech,
France),
and
then
incubated with anti-HLA-G antibody (4H84) [32]. After washing
in RPMI, the 4H84 coated beads were incubated overnight at 4uC
with M8-HLA-G5 supernatant. The beads were then washed and
suspended in culture medium. Control beads were incubated with
supernatant of M8 melanoma transfected with the pcDNA empty
vector.
Biochemistry and western blot analysis
Cells were activated for 3 days with OKT3 and IL-2, and
incubated in the absence or presence of 30 ml of HLA-G5-beads.
Then, cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and lysed
with buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mM Tris (pH = 7.4),
150 Mm NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Nonidet-P40, Benzonase
0.5 U/ml, 1 mM Orthovanadate, and 1% protease inhibitors
256(Complete; Boehringer Mannheim). the cells were then boiled
in Laemmli buffer 26 with 10% b2-mercaptoethanol.
Total protein was extracted and quantified using the BCA
protein assay kit (Pierce). Proteins were then resolved on 7.5%
SDS–PAGE
and
transferred
onto
polyvinylidene
difluoride
(PVDF) membranes.
After blocking non-specific binding with 5% bovine serum
albumin (BSA) in PBS-0.1%Tween for 1 h at room temperature,
the membranes were immunoblotted using primary antibodies.
Immunoreactive proteins were visualized with horseradish perox-
idase-coupled HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or HRP-
conjugated
sheep
anti-rabbit
IgG,
and
enhanced
using
a
chemiluminescence detection system.
Immuno-precipitation and immunoblotting
Cells were stimulated with OKT3 and IL-2 for 3 days, and
incubated in the absence or presence of 30 ml of HLA-G5-beads
for 15 min, 30 min, and 1 h at 37uC. Afterwards, the cells were
washed and lysed at 4uC with a buffer solution containing 1%
TritonX100, 5 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris–HCl
(pH = 7.4), 1 mM orthovanadate, 1 mM PMSF (phenylmethylsul-
phonyl fluoride), and 1% protease inhibitors 256 (Complete;
Boehringer Mannheim) for 10 min. The lysates were then
centrifuged (2000 rpm) and the supernatant was incubated
overnight at 4uC with specific antibodies, and then with magnetic
beads coated with goat anti-mouse IgG for 2 h at 4uC. After
washing with lysed buffer, the protein–antibody-bead complexes
were boiled in a Laemmli buffer 26, resolved on 8% SDS–PAGE,
and were analyzed using western-blot methodology.
Inhibition of SHP-2
In order to interfere with the function of SHP-2, stimulated T
cells were pre-treated with a specific chemical inhibitor, NSC-
87877 (5 mM), for 3 h [33]. To inactivate the SHP-2 gene, cells
were transfected with anti-SHP-2-siRNA (75 ng) or control siRNA

(75 ng) (Dharmacon) with HIPerfect Transfection reagent (Qia-
gen). Cells were transfected with 75 ng of siRNA and HIPerfect
for 48 h. T cells were stimulated with OKT3 and IL2 for 24 h in
the absence or presence of 30 ml of HLA-G5-beads for 1 h. Total
protein extracts then underwent western-blot analysis.
Immunofluorescence
Cells were activated for 3 days, and incubated with HLA-G5-
beads for 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, and 2 h. Afterwards, cells were
washed twice with ice-cold PBS and fixed with 3% paraformal-
dehyde (PFA) in PBS for 30 min at 4uC. Cells were then incubated
with NH4Cl 100 mM in PBS for 10 min. Cells were permeabi-
lyzed with PBS containing 0.05% Triton X100 for 5 min and
stained with primary antibodies for 1 h, followed by secondary
antibodies conjugated with a specific fluorochrome for 1 h at room
temperature.
For primary antibodies, anti-SHP-2 was diluted at 1:100 and
anti-ILT-2 was diluted at 1:25. Nuclei were stained with DAPI
(1:5000). The secondary antibodies used were goat anti-rabbit IgG
coupled with FITC (1:100; Jackson Immuno Research), and
donkey anti-mouse IgG coupled with PE (1:25; Jackson Immuno
Research).
Results
LILRB1 is required for the inhibitory effect of HLA-G on T
lymphocytes
In the presence of soluble HLA-G, proliferation of activated T
cells is inhibited. This inhibition is dramatically reduced in the
presence of the HLA-G blocking antibody (87G) and/or the
presence of the anti-LILRB1 antibody, indicating a requirement
for LILRB1 in the inhibitory function of HLA-G (Figure 1A, B).
To determine which phosphatase is associated with LILRB1,
LILRB1 was immune-precipitated and submitted to gel electro-
phoresis. Co-precipitated SHP-1 or SHP-2 phosphatases were
detected by western-blot analyses. In human-activated T lympho-
cytes, SHP-2, and to a less extend SHP-1, was associated with
LILRB1 (Figure 2). This was confirmed by immuno-precipitating

SHP1 or SHP-2, and subsequently detecting LILRB1 by western
blotting. SHP-2 and to a less extend SHP-1 were associated with
LILRB1 (Figure 2).
After incubation with HLA-G, the amount of SHP-2 that co-
precipitated with LILRB1 was slightly decreased. SHP-1 remained
not associated with LILRB1. We also searched for the phosphor-
ylated status of SHP-1 and SHP-2. We found that the incubation of
activated T cells with HLA-G was not correlated with the rapid
phosphorylation of SHP-1 (Figure 3A), but was with SHP-2
(Figure 4A). The phosphorylation of SHP-2 was observed at 1
and 2 h after incubating the cells with HLA-G and then decreased
after 4 h. In addition, the amount of SHP-2 was increased as shown
Figure 4A, but was delayed compared to its phosphorylation. In
contrast, the amount of SHP-1 was not modified. By immunoflu-
orescence, the distribution of SHP-2 was rapidly modified following
the interaction of HLA-G with its receptor. SHP-2, which was
distributed in the cytoplasm and also in the nucleus at a steady state,
will thus be relocated intracellularly and partially co-distributed with
LILRB1 when they have been incubated with HLA-G (Figure 5).
HLA-G is associated with inhibition of the m-TOR
pathway, but not the TCR-dependent pathway
To investigate which pathways of activated T cells were affected
by phosphatase SHP-2, we first tested whether the TCR-
dependent pathway could be modified by incubating T cells with
HLA-G. In activated T cells, the phosphorylated zeta chains of the
CD3 complex remained phosphorylated (Figure S2). Both ERK
and JNK, which are phosphorylated following TCR activation,

were not modified and remained phosphorylated. Only p38
phosphorylation was increased after 1 h of HLA-G incubation
(Figure 3B).
Because the proliferation of T cells depends on IL2, which in
turn activates the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway (the third signal for
the activation of T cells), we determined the status of these proteins
(Figure 4A). In activated T cells, both Akt and mTOR were
phosphorylated. In the presence of HLA-G, phospho-Akt was
increased but phospho-mTOR was dramatically reduced, whereas
the quantity of mTOR was not modified: this suggests that HLA-
G impairs the phosphorylated status of mTOR. Moreover, p70-
S6K, which acts downstream of mTOR, was also dephosphory-
lated in a time-dependent manner, indicating that mTOR was not
functional any longer.
SHP-2 control of the phosphorylated status of mTOR
To demonstrate the interaction between the activation of SHP-2
and inhibition of the mTOR pathway, the function of SHP-2 was
inhibited, firstly, by using a specific inhibitor of SHP-2 (NSC-
87877) and, secondly, by using siRNA against SHP-2. Transfec-
tion of T cells with siRNA against SHP-2 was associated with a
dramatic decrease of SHP-2 in cells determined by western-blot
analysis as compared to cells transfected with controlled siRNA
(Figure 4B). As expected, in untreated cells, the incubation of
activated T cells with HLA-G was associated with a significant
reduction of phospho-mTOR. In contrast, in activated T cells
incubated with NSC-87877 or transfected with the siRNA against
SHP-2, incubation with HLA-G was not associated with decreased
phospho-mTOR (Figure 4C). This indicates that HLA-G induces
mTOR dephosphorylation through SHP-2 activation. In contrast,
in cells transfected with control si-RNA, the incubation of HLA-G
led to dephosphorylation of m-TOR (data not shown).
To determine whether the regulation of the mTOR pathway by
SHP-2 is important for the control of cell-cycle entry induced by
HLA-G, activated T lymphocytes were transfected with siRNA
against SHP-2 prior to incubation with HLA-G (figure 4D).
Figure 5. A: Transcriptional inhibition of SHP-2 with siRNA against SHP-2. Activated T cells were transfected with siRNA against SHP or a

87877, incubation with HLAG5-coated beads was not associated with mTOR dephosphorylation. C: The ratio of p-mTOR/actin has been determined

following incubation with HLA-G5, whereas it was observed in T cells transfected with siRNA–control.

Following incubation of the cells with HLA-G, the reappearance
of p27kip was determined by western-blot analysis. In cells
transfected with siRNA against SHP-2, p27kip did reappear after
incubation of cells with HLA-G whereas, in cells transfected with
control siRNA, it was not expressed.
Discussion
Our results indicate, for the first time, that the regulatory
functions of HLA-G on T-cell proliferation is associated with the
activation of SHP-2, which induces mTOR inhibition.
The function of HLA-G requires interaction of its a3 domain
with LILRB1, and this can be inhibited by using blocking
antibodies against either HLA-G or LILRB1. LILRB1 contains, in
its intracellular domain, four ITIM motifs that participate in the
transmission of the negative signal. Following its phosphorylation,
LILRB1 has been demonstrated to interact with phosphatase
SHP-1 through its SH2 domain. In activated lymphocytes, we
found no specific interaction between LILRB1 and SHP-1 in T
cells incubated or not with HLA-G. However, we observed that
LILRB1 was associated with ubiquitous phosphatase SHP-2 in
activated T cells, but not in resting lymphocytes (data not shown).
Our results suggest that the activation of T cells is associated with
the direct or indirect modification of SHP-2 and/or LILRB1, thus
participating in SHP-2 activation. This is in accordance with the
results published by Liang et al., which show that in dendritic cells
overexpressing LILRB2, another member of the ILT family,
HLA-G correlated with the association of SHP1 and, to a lesser
extent,
SHP-2
with
LILRB2
[34].
However,
only
SHP-2
downregulation by shRNA was associated with the inhibition of
the regulatory function of HLA-G, indicating that SHP-2 is
required for signal transmission in dendritic cells downstream of
LILRB4.
After HLA-G interaction, SHP-2 becomes rapidly phosphory-
lated. In addition, the total amount of SHP-2 was increased with
some delay compared to its phosphorylation. The phosphorylation
of SHP-2 correlates with a redistribution of SHP-2 into the
cytoplasm of the cell. In contrast to the transmembrane phos-
phatase CD45, activation of SHP1 or SHP-2, the two phospha-
tases without no transmembrane domains, can impair the first
signal of activation [35,36]. In human T cells activated with either
OKT3/CD28mAb or OKT3/IL2, several lines of evidence
suggest that HLA-G does not interfere with the first activation
signal of T cells. Activated-T cells, in the presence of HLA-G, first
exhibit a phenotype of the activated cells with regard to their size
and granularity (39), and then, secondly, the expression of surface
markers (CD45R0+, CD62L2, CD45RA2). In addition, we
observed that, in the presence of HLA-G, the CD3f chain, MAP
kinase, JNK, and p38, which all act downstream of TCR and CD28,
are not modified following incubation with HLA-G and remain
phosphorylated. In contrast, we have observed that the third signal of
activation, which involves the Akt/mTOR pathway downstream of
the IL2 receptor, was modulated. After HLA-G binding, the
mTOR/raptor molecule and p70S6K, which act downstream of
mTOR, appear to become rapidly dephosphorylated, whereas Akt,
which acts upstream of mTOR, is not downregulated. These results
are in agreement with previous results, indicating that, in SHP-2,
KO only affects the activation status of mTOR but not Akt in
fibroblasts stimulated with IGF1 (40). IGF1 interacts with its
receptor to turn on the Akt/mTOR pathway by activating Jak1/3
molecules, as IL2 does in T cells. By using SHP-2 KO mice, Zito et
al. have demonstrated that, in the absence of SHP-2, a higher
phosphorylation status of mTOR was observed. However, the
mechanism that regulates SHP-2 activation in fibroblasts remains
unknown.
By using a specific inhibitor of SHP-2, NSC-87877, or by
inhibiting SHP-2 with siRNA, we have shown that mTOR is
phosphorylated regardless of the presence of HLA-G: this
indicates that, as for fibroblasts, SHP-2 regulates the mTOR
pathway. We also found that SHP-2 acts upstream and does not
reduce the phosphorylated status of Akt. In addition, by using
siRNA, we have demonstrated that SHP-2 participates in the
inhibition of cell-cycle entry and is associated with the accumu-
lation of protein p27kip. In addition, based on these results,
Morandi et al. have observed in T cells, that the chemical inhibitor
of SHP-2 restored the altered expression of cell-surface expression
of chemokine receptor CXCR5 when it was induced by HLA-G
[37]. Altogether, these data indicate that SHP-2 has the ability to
control the cytokine/growth-factor pathway by acting downstream
of Akt and inhibiting the active form of mTOR. Whether
hyperphosphorylation of Akt plays a role in this sequence needs to
be determined.

encoding HLA-G transfected cells with the 4H84 mAb. A:
HELA cells transitly transfected with the cDNA encoding HLA-
G5 were fixed with paraformaldehyde 3% and then permeabe-
lized with saponin 0.01%. They were subsequently incubated with
FITC conjugated 4H84 mAb (Green) and DAPI. B: Melanoma
cell line (M8) stably transfected with the cDNA encoding HLA-G1
were incubated with the biotinylated MEM-G9 mAb and then
FITC-streptavidin (left panel) (dark gray) or with the FITC
conjugated 4H84 mAb (right panel) (dark gray) and analysed by
FASC. Isotype control appears in light gray.
