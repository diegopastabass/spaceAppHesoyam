Abstract
Tardigrades represent one of the main animal groups with anhydrobiotic capacity at any
stage of their life cycle. The ability of tardigrades to survive repeated cycles of anhydrobio-
sis has rarely been studied but is of interest to understand the factors constraining anhydro-
biotic survival. The main objective of this study was to investigate the patterns of survival of
the eutardigrade Richtersius coronifer under repeated cycles of desiccation, and the poten-
tial effect of repeated desiccation on size, shape and number of storage cells. We also ana-
lyzed potential change in body size, gut content and frequency of mitotic storage cells.
Specimens were kept under non-cultured conditions and desiccated under controlled rela-
tive humidity. After each desiccation cycle 10 specimens were selected for analysis of mor-
phometric characteristics and mitosis. The study demonstrates that tardigrades may
survive up to 6 repeated desiccations, with declining survival rates with increased number
of desiccations. We found a significantly higher proportion of animals that were unable to
contract properly into a tun stage during the desiccation process at the 5th and 6th desicca-
tions. Also total number of storage cells declined at the 5th and 6th desiccations, while no
effect on storage cell size was observed. The frequency of mitotic storage cells tended to
decline with higher number of desiccation cycles. Our study shows that the number of con-
secutive cycles of anhydrobiosis that R. coronifer may undergo is limited, with increased
inability for tun formation and energetic constraints as possible causal factors.
Introduction
Water availability is one of the most important ecologicalfactors and evolutionary pressures
on terrestrial life. Despite the fact that water is crucial for all life forms, numerous organisms
(including prokaryotes, protozoa, fungi, plants and animals) survive temporary drying to equi-
librium with the air humidity by entering a highly stable and reversible state called anhydrobio-
sis, a special form of the ametabolic life state known as cryptobiosis [1,2,3,4,5]. During
anhydrobiosis the organism loses most of its water by evaporation and has to protect cell

structures from damage caused by water loss [6]. The biochemical and physiological nature of
such protectant systems in anhydrobiotic organisms are not well understood, but are of consid-
erable interest both from a general biological perspective and from the applied sciences where
dry biological systems play an important role (e.g., medicine and food storage) [7,8].
Among animals, tardigrades represent one of the main groups in which a capacity for anhy-
drobiosis is widespread. Tardigrades are microscopic aquatic animals found in a variety of hab-
itats worldwide [9], and they are particularly common in semi-terrestrial microhabitats such as
mosses, lichens and leaf litter. In these environments they are exposed to periods of desiccation
that varies in frequency and length, and the anhydrobiotic capacity of semi-terrestrial tardi-
grades is an evolutionary adaptation to survive under such conditions. Their ability to enter
anhydrobiosis is well documented [5,10,11], and the anhydrobiotic state may be entered recur-
rently and at any stage of their life cycle (so-called “holo-anhydrobiosis”; [12]).
The state of anhydrobiosis, characterized as an ametabolic condition, is not connected with
any energy consumption, and this explains why tardigrades may stay in this state for many
years, even decades, and still be able to revive [13,14]. However, the entrance into and exit of
anhydrobiosis relies on physiological processes that are likely to be energetically costly, and evi-
dence of energy-depletionin storage cells (coelomocyteswith circulatory and energy storage
functions) of tardigrades over a single cycle of anhydrobiosis has been reported [15,16]. This
suggests that multiple cycles of anhydrobiosis may eventually deplete the energy stores of the
animal and represent a potential constraint on how many times in a row a tardigrade may suc-
cessfully enter anhydrobiosis, given that energy stores cannot be replenished by feeding. Apart
from energy depletion, desiccation may also give rise to damage to cell components, including
DNA [17], and multiple anhydrobiotic periods may therefore also challenge the maintenance
of cell structure integrity.
Very few previous studies have evaluated how many consecutive periods of anhydrobiosis
that tardigrades are able to survive. According to Baumann [18], Lance [19] was the first to
examine repeated desiccation in tardigrades, reporting survival of 8–14 desiccations, but only
three eutardigrade specimens were used. Baumann [18] reported the first and so far the only
more extensive study on this subject, including 15 animals of the genus Macrobiotus (species
not given). The results showed that single specimens were able to survive up to 9 repeated des-
iccations, but already after 5 desiccations about 50% of the animals had died. The only other
study where tardigrades have been exposed to several sequential cycles of anhydrobiosis is that
by Hengherr et al. [20], in which specimens of the eutardigrade Milnesium tardigradum were
repeatedly desiccated with intermediate 7-day periods of hydration under cultured conditions
allowing feeding. The study found no decline in anhydrobiotic performance over 9 consecutive
desiccations.
The purpose of the current study was to investigate the patterns of survival in a tardigrade
under repeated cycles of desiccation/rehydration and the potential effect of repeated desicca-
tion on size, shape and number of storage cells. We also analyzed if body size, gut content and
frequency of mitosis in storage cells change over the course of repeated desiccation.
Materials and Methods
Study organism
In our desiccation experiment we used medium sized (average body length of 653 μm, n = 80)
specimens of the eutardigrade Richtersius coronifer (Richters, 1903). The population consists
almost exclusively of females [21]. No culturing method has been developed for this species,
and specimens were extracted from a natural moss-living population in Alvar habitat of the
island Öland (see [22] for description of the Alvar area). The study did not involve endangered

or protected species, and moss samples were not collected within an area where permission
was required. Moss (Orthotrichum cupulatum) containing tardigrades were collected dry and
stored at room temperature for 3 days until use. Moss cushions were hydrated for about 2
hours in tap water and within the following 3 hours 400 active specimens were extracted with
sieves (mesh size 250 and 40 μm) under running tap water. Extracted animals were washed
thoroughly with distilled water to remove adherent particles.
Anhydrobiotic induction and recovery
The general procedure of our study consisted of repeated 24 hour periods of desiccation at 95%
relative humidity (RH) followed by 5 hours of rehydration. These times were assumed to pro-
vide enough time for the animal to enter anhydrobiosis and to rehydrate and adjust physiologi-
cally for the hydrated state, respectively. After each desiccation cycle, 10 revived specimens
were selected for analysis of mitosis in storage cells and morphometric characteristics, and the
remaining animals that were alive were mixed and prepared for a new period of desiccation.
This procedure was repeated until there were too few alive animals to continue.
At the start of the experiment, 400 randomly chosen specimens were put individually on ten
replicate filter papers (5 x 2 cm) in petri dishes and transferred into a desiccator with a satu-
rated potassium nitrate (KNO3) salt solution providing a relative humidity of 95%. The 24h
desiccation allowed the animals to enter anhydrobiosis and equilibrate with the surrounding
humidity condition. Since the total number of animals available for each new desiccation cycle
steadily declined (due to removal of specimens for analysis + mortality of some specimens at
each cycle), the mean number of animals in each replicate was a decreasing function of the
number of desiccation cycles (1st cycle = 40 specimens/replicate, 2nd = 38.4, 3rd = 31.5, 4th =
22.9, 5th = 14.9, 6th = 3.5). In all desiccation cycles the number of specimens in the 10 replicates
differed by maximum one animal.
Before each rehydration all specimens were examined under stereomicroscope and the
number of animals in tun stage (S1A Fig), semi-tun stage (body not fully contracted, S1B Fig)
and extended (non-tun) stage (S1C Fig) in each sample were recorded. Gut content was also
recorded and specimens were classified as having gut content (dark gut) or no gut content (yel-
low gut). Twenty hydrated animals not included in the desiccation experiment were initially
selected and used as controls for comparison with the repeatedly dehydrated animals.
Survival of the rehydrated animals was evaluated after 3 and 5 hours, and the latter estimate
was used for most animals in the survival analysis. However, in the survival estimate we also
included the 10 specimens selected for mitosis and morphometric analysis, and these were col-
lected at the 3 hour survival estimate. All specimens alive at the 3 hour evaluation were also
alive after 5 hours. No specimens inactive during all 5 hours of rehydration recovered after this
time (dead specimens were examined for 24 hours). Animals were assumed to be dead if there
was no visible body movement. After each rehydration period, alive specimens were put
together in a single dish and transferred individually with an Irwin loop to 10 new filter papers,
followed by a new period of desiccation. For each replicate sample within a desiccation-rehy-
dration cycle the proportion of surviving animals was calculated and used in the analysis.
Initial observations and preparation for analysis
The 10 animals randomly selected after each desiccation/rehydration cycle were transferred in
a drop of water to an object slide, covered with a cover slip, and observedunder light micro-
scope (Olympus BX60) fitted with a digital camera (INFINITY1, Lumenera Corp.). Images of
the whole animal, buccal tube and storage cells were taken for later measurements using the
image analysis software (INFINITYANALYZE 6.0, Lumenera Corp.). The time for collection

of all images for a single specimen was about 10 minutes. Images for measurement of buccal
tube and storage cells were taken at 40X magnification.
After initial observation specimens were transferred into Carnoys´ solution for 3 hours and
stained in toto in a drop of acetic-lactic orcein according to the method used by Rebecchi [23].
Slides were examined the following day under the light microscope.
Analysis of morphometric characteristics and mitosis
Measured morphometric variables were body length, buccal tube length, gut content, size and
shape of storage cells and presence of mitotic storage cells. Measurement of total body length
was taken from anterior to posterior part of the body excluding the fourth pair of legs, and buc-
cal tube length was measured according to the description by Pilato [24]. The measurements of
body size and buccal tube length were significantly correlated (Pearson correlation; r = 0.27,
N = 62, P = 0.036), and in order to include also specimens that were in a simplex stage without
buccal tube (about 22% of the data) we only used body length in our analyses. Gut content was
analyzed at 20X magnification and classified as empty, medium (part of gut filled with brown-
ish coloration material) or full (gut filled with black material). Note that these analyses of gut
content represent a different estimate than that made on all animals prior to rehydration (dark
gut/yellow gut).
Storage cell shape and size were estimated from 20 randomly selected cells per individual
(and from different parts of the bodies). Cell size was calculated as the mean of two diagonal
right angle diameter measurements for each cell. From the diameter measurement cell volume
was calculated (assuming a spherical shape) and used in the analysis. Shape of the cells was
characterized for each examined individual as regular (spherical) or irregular (crescent or bor-
ders not straight). There were no specimens with mixed cell shapes; all cells in an animal were
either regular or irregular.
In order to calculate the mitotic index (proportion of all storage cells that were in mitosis) at
the individual level, the total number of clearly recognizable storage cells was estimated manu-
ally at 100X magnification with phase contrast and oil, using image analysis software (see
above). Smashed cells, without clear borders, were not counted. Mitotic storage cells (S2 Fig)
were identified from the presence of condensed chromosomes.
In total 420 specimens were used in the experiment, 400 specimens in the repeated desicca-
tion sequence and 20 as controls. Mitosis and morphometric analyses were performed on 80
specimens.
Statistical analyses
Statistical effects on survival of repeated desiccations were tested using ANOVA and linear
regression analysis (IBM SPSS Statistics v.23). Proportion data were arcsin-transformed before
statistical analyses. In tests where parametric assumptions were not met, non-parametric statis-
tics were used. Associations between mitosis occurrence and desiccation cycles/phenotypic
traits were analyzed with logistic regression. Statistical tests were considered significant when
P < 0.05, and marginally significant when P = 0.05.
Results
Survival rates after repeated desiccations
Survival rates differed significantly among the repeated desiccations (F5,54 = 20.96, P < 0.001;
Fig 1 and Table A in S1 File) and the trend was a clear and significant decline in survival rate
with increased number of desiccation cycles (linear regression; F1,58 = 87.62, r = –0.78,

P < 0.001). The highest survival rate was recorded after the first desiccation (98.5%) and the
lowest non-zero survival rate was recorded after the sixth desiccation (28.6%). After the 6th des-
iccation only 10 specimens were alive and all of these were used for morphometric and mitosis
analyses.
Associations between repeated desiccations and phenotypic traits
based on examination of all specimens after each desiccation cycle
The proportion of animals that were in a semi-tun stage after the 24h desiccation differed sig-
nificantly among desiccation cycle groups (F5,54 = 8.96, P = 0.000), with desiccation groups 5
and 6 having significantly more semi-tuns than most of the other groups (Fig 2 and Table A in
S1 File). A similar pattern was observedfor animals that were in an extended state after desic-
cation but within-group variation was high and there were no significant differences among
desiccation groups (F5,54 = 1.57, P = 0.19; Fig 2 and Table A in S1 File). The proportion of ani-
mals with dark gut content after desiccation differed significantly among desiccation cycle
groups (Kruskal-Wallis; χ2 = 15.0, df = 5, P = 0.010; Fig 3 and Table A in S1 File), with the 1st
and 2nd desiccation group having a significantly lower proportion of specimens with dark guts
compared to groups 4–6.

Associations between repeated desiccations and phenotypic traits
based on 10 selected specimens after each desiccation cycle
There was an overall significant difference in the mean number of storage cells among desicca-
tion cycle groups, including also the control group (F6,72 = 3.91, P = 0.002; Fig 4 and Table B in
S1 File). This difference was exclusively due to significantly lower number of storage cells in
animals exposed to five (P = 0.015) and six (P = 0.004) desiccation cycles, compared to the con-
trol animals. No significant differences were found among desiccation cycle groups (including
controls) with respect to body length (F6,73 = 2.07, P = 0.067; Table B in S1 File) or storage cell
volume (F6,69 = 0.99, P = 0.44; Fig 4 and Table B in S1 File). The storage cells had regular shape
in almost all of the specimens, and only one control specimen and two specimens of the first
desiccation group were characterized as having irregular cells. The proportion of animals in
different gut content categories did not differ significantly among desiccation cycle groups
(χ2 = 18.4, df = 12, P = 0.10), and there was no trend in gut content in relation to number of
desiccation cycles (Spearman´s rank Analysis; rs = 0.10, N = 80, P = 0.37).
Frequency of mitosis in storage cells
Storage cells undergoing mitosis were found in 17.5% (14/80) of all examined specimens. The
average percentage of mitotic storage cells among all cells (“mitotic index”) was 0.28%
(SD = 1.25, n = 79) when all analyzed animals (also zero-values) were included, and 1.60%
(SD = 2.65, 0.11–10.19%, n = 14) when only animals where mitosis was found were included.

The proportion of animals with mitotic storage cells in each desiccation cycle varied between 0
and 0.4 (Table 1). Occurrence of mitotic cells in an individual specimen was not related to stor-
age cell volume (Wald = 0.39, df = 1, P = 0.53), gut content (Wald = 3.02, df = 2, P = 0.22), or
body length (Wald = 0.040, df = 1, P = 0.84), but was significantly negatively associated with
number of desiccation cycles (ß = –0.32, Wald = 3.89, df = 1, P = 0.049) and positively associ-
ated with storage cell number (ß = 0.003, Wald = 4.064, df = 1, P = 0.044). Animals with no
mitotic cells had on average 699 (SD = 221) storage cells, while animals with mitotic cells had
832 (SD = 155) storage cells. There was a significant negative correlation between the mitotic
index for an animal and the number of repeated desiccations that it had experienced(rs = –
0.23, P = 0.041, n = 79, Table 1). Thus, the frequency of mitosis tended to decline with the
number of desiccation cycles and increase with number of storage cells. Since both mitosis
occurrenceand storage cell number tended to decline with number of repeated desiccations
(see previous section), it is difficult to disentangle the causal relationships between mitosis,
storage cell number and number of repeated desiccations.
Discussion
Our study shows that tardigrades of the species R. coronifer are able to survive a maximum of 6
repeated desiccations under non-cultured conditions, with declining survival rates as the num-
ber of desiccations increased. This result is slightly lower than in the study by Baumann [18]
who reported animals surviving up to 9 desiccation cycles. Fig 5 compares these two studies
with respect to the proportion of the initial population of animals survivingafter different

numbers of desiccation cycles. Since we removed 10 specimens after each desiccation cycle, the
proportion of survivals in relation to the initial population were calculated based on the specific
desiccation cycle survival rate (given in Table A in S1 File) and the number of animals entering
each cycle had we not removed those 10 surviving specimens. Both figures suggest that R. coro-
nifer has a steeper decline in survival rate with increased number of desiccation cycles,

compared to Baumann [18]. However, Baumann [18] only used 15 animals in total, and the
last desiccation cycles included very few animals (the 9th only one animal, which survived!).He
also used a different desiccation-hydration schedule, with 24 hour desiccations (at 35–45% rel-
ative humidity), and 15 minute rehydrations. His results must therefore be taken with some
caution. In contrast to Baumann [18] and the current study, Hengherr et al. [20] did not
observe a decline in the probability to survive a cycle of anhydrobiosis over 9 consecutive desic-
cations (recovery rates were 88–100%), but the animals were allowed to feed and replenish
their energy stores for 7 days between the desiccations, which naturally could have influenced
the results.
The decline in the probability of a tardigrade to survive a desiccation cycle with number of
previous desiccations suggests a progressive deterioration in the functions underlying anhydro-
biosis. One plausible explanation for this limitation on multiple desiccations is that the animals
eventually reach an energetic constraint, where the physiological processes necessary for the
transition to and from the anhydrobiotic state is not supported by available energy. In support
of this explanation our analyses showed a significant reduction in the number of storage cells
after the fifth desiccation, indicating reabsorption of cells. Reabsorption of storage cells was
also reported by Węglarska [25] as an effect of starvation in specimens of the eutardigrade Dac-
tylobiotus dispar Murray, 1907 (formerly: Macrobiotus dispar). Howeverowever, data from

study and in that reported by Baumann [18]. Note that survival data from the current study were calculated based
on estimated rates of survival for each desiccation cycle, not on the original number of animals, since 10 surviving
animals were removed for analysis after each desiccation cycle. Initial number of animals: 400 in this study, 15 in
Baumann´s study [18]. See main text for more detailed explanation.

continuously hydrated conditions at room temperature did not show a significant decline in
number of storage cells (Czernekova & Jönsson, unpublished data). It is therefore not likely
that the reduced storage cell number in this study was related to starvation during the short (5
hour) repeated periods of hydration.
Energy depletion connected to anhydrobiosis is also expected to lead to reduced size of the
storage cells, as previously shown by Jönsson and Rebecchi [15]. In that study, storage cell area
decreased by 14% over a single desiccation cycle in R. coronifer, corresponding to a decrease in
cell volume by 22%. Decreased storage cell size has also been documented in the late phase of
oogenesis, when energy investment into the eggs are high [15,26]. At this phase, food intake is
prevented partly due to body cavity constraints, and partly because the feeding apparatus is
expelled in connection with the onset of moulting (a stage called “simplex”). Reuner et al. [16]
also reported significantly reduced storage cell size in three eutardigrade species (M. tardigra-
dum, Paramacrobiotus tonollii and Macrobiotus sapiens) in response to 7 days of starvation,
and in M. tardigradum in response to one cycle of anhydrobiosis. However, the number of
storage cells in that study [16] was not affected neither by starvation nor by a period of anhy-
drobiosis. In our study, no significant reduction in cell size was found, even after several desic-
cation cycles. We also found no evidence that the energy depositions represented by gut
content were depleted by repeated desiccation, a finding that was also reported by Baumann
[18] in his study on repeated desiccation. Several previous studies on R. coronifer show that
this species is able to survive continuous starvation at room temperature for many days and
even weeks [27,28]. The declining survival rates after multiple desiccations therefore cannot be
due to depletion of energy from the hydrated periods. The energy demands and role of storage
cells in anhydrobiotic survival of R. coronifer therefore remains unclear.
The decline in survival with more desiccation cycles, particularly clear in the 5th and 6th
cycle, corresponded with a higher proportion of animals that were unable to contract properly
and create tuns when they were desiccated. This was also observedby Baumann [18], who sug-
gested that the animals after a number (4 to 7) of repeated desiccations were unable to produce
a cuticular secretion that prevented too rapid desiccation, resulting in uncontrolled contraction
of the body and its organs and therefore incomplete tun formation. Our results on changes in
body morphology over repeated desiccations are thus fully compatible with those of Baumann
[18], but we did not evaluate any characteristics of the cuticle. Whether the failed tun forma-
tion after repeated desiccations is related to incomplete cuticular secretion remains to be stud-
ied, and ultrastructure analyses of cuticle and epidermis in animals exposed to different
number of repeated desiccations would be highly interesting in this context.
The overall frequency of mitosis found in this study was similar to that reported in Czerne-
kova and Jönsson [29], who found mitosis in 18.3% of the adult individuals of R. coronifer, and
a mitotic index of 1.47% (based on individuals where mitotic cells were found). In that study it
was also found that a higher frequency of mitosis was connected with the period of moulting
which usually corresponds to the late phase of egg development. As mentioned above, that
period is also characterized by smaller storage cells [15,26], but neither in the study by Czerne-
kova and Jönsson [29] nor in the current study was cell size found to be associated with fre-
quency of mitosis. Instead, the frequency of mitosis in storage cells tended to decline with the
number of repeated desiccations and the total number of storage cells. Since the latter variable
also declined with the number of repeated desiccations it is difficultto know if storage cell
number directly affected mitosis frequency, or if both mitosis frequency and storage cell num-
ber were influenced by some other common factor related to repeated desiccation. However,
the possibility that frequency of mitosis in storage cell is stimulated by energetic stress receives
no support from our study, since this would predict an increase in mitosis with repeated desic-
cations, rather than the observeddecrease.

In conclusion, our study clearly shows that the ability of Richtersius coronifer to enter and
successfully leave the anhydrobiotic state declines with the number of previous anhydrobiotic
cycles experienced,thus verifying a limit of how many times this tardigrade can enter anhydro-
biosis in a row. The causal explanation behind this decline in anhydrobiotic performance is
unclear, but increased inability to morphologically rearrange the body into a proper tun seems
to be involved. The ultimate physiological or energetic reason for this remains to be
documented.

S1 File. Table A. Survivalestimates for different number of repeated desiccation cycles,
and the number and percentage of specimensthat were in semi-tun or extended state. a The
total number of specimens were divided into 10 replicate samples. b Survival was evaluated
after 3 and 5 hours of rehydration, except for specimens that were chosen for morphometry
and mitosis analyses, which were evaluated 3 hours after rehydration. c Specimens with irregu-
lar tun were characterized as “semi-tun stage”. d Specimens that did not contract during desic-
cation. See Method section for more information. Table B. Mean number and size (diameter)
of storage cells after repeated cycles of desiccations.Estimates for group 0 (controls) were
based on 19–20 specimens, while estimates for the other groups were based on 10 specimens.
Four outliers with cell diameters > 20 um were removed from the data; two from group 0
(5440 and 8662 um3), one from group 1 (4571 um3), and one from group 6 (10409 um3).
