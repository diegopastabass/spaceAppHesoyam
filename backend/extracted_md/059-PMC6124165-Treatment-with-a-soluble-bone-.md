Abstract
Reduced mechanical stress is a major cause of osteoporosis in the elderly, and the osteocyte network, which comprises a
communication system through processes and canaliculi throughout bone, is thought to be a mechanosensor and
mechanotransduction system; however, the functions of osteocytes are still controversial and remain to be clarified.
Unexpectedly, we found that overexpression of BCL2 in osteoblasts eventually caused osteocyte apoptosis. Osteoblast and
osteoclast differentiation were unaffected by BCL2 transgene in vitro. However, the cortical bone mass increased due to
enhanced osteoblast function and suppressed osteoclastogenesis at 4 months of age, when the frequency of TUNEL-
positive lacunae reached 75%. In the unloaded condition, the trabecular bone mass decreased in both wild-type and BCL2
transgenic mice at 6 weeks of age, while it decreased due to impaired osteoblast function and enhanced osteoclastogenesis
in wild-type mice but not in BCL2 transgenic mice at 4 months of age. Rankl and Opg were highly expressed in osteocytes,
but Rankl expression in osteoblasts but not in osteocytes was increased at unloading in wild-type mice but not in BCL2
transgenic mice at 4 months of age. Sost was locally induced at unloading in wild-type mice but not in BCL2 transgenic
mice, and the dissemination of Sost was severely interrupted in BCL2 transgenic mice, showing the severely impaired
osteocyte network. These findings indicate that the osteocyte network is required for the upregulation of Rankl in
osteoblasts and Sost in osteocytes in the unloaded condition. These findings suggest that the osteocyte network negatively
regulate bone mass by inhibiting osteoblast function and activating osteoclastogenesis, and these functions are augmented
in the unloaded condition at least partly through the upregulation of Rankl expression in osteoblasts and that of Sost in
osteocytes, although it cannot be excluded that low BCL2 transgene expression in osteoblasts contributed to the enhanced
osteoblast function.

Introduction
Bone tissue is able to adapt its mass and three-dimensional
structure to the prevailing mechanical usage to achieve higher
load-bearing efficiency [1]. The lacunocanalicular network formed
by osteocytes is thought to be an ideal mechanosensory system and
suitable for mechanotransduction, by which mechanical energy is
converted into electrical and/or biochemical signals [2], [3], [4],
[5], [6], [7]; however, the function of the osteocyte network in the
regulation of bone mass remains to be clarified.
The function of osteocytes in bone formation is controversial.
Osteocytes have been considered to activate bone formation,
because osteocytes induced anabolic factors, such as prostaglan-
din E2 (PGE2), prostaglandin I2 (PGI2), nitric oxide (NO),
cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and endothelial nitric oxide synthase
(ecNOS), after application of mechanical stimuli in vitro [5] and
bone formation was severely inhibited after osteocyte ablation
[8]. However, Marotti et al. theorized that osteocytes inhibit
osteoblasts by means of inhibitory signals transmitted via gap
junctions and recruit selected osteoblasts to the osteocyte lineage
[9]. In accordance with this theory, osteocyte density and bone
formation rate were inversely related [10], [11]. Further,
Sclerostin,
the
SOST
gene
protein
product,
is
specifically
expressed in osteocytes and inhibits osteoblast function and bone
formation by antagonizing canonical Wnt signaling through the
binding to Wnt co-receptor low density lipoprotein receptor-
related protein (LRP) 5 and LRP6, and Sost-deficient mice are
resistant to bone loss at unloading [12], [13], [14], [15], [16],
[17], [18], [19], [20].
Osteocytes have been considered to suppress bone resorption
because osteocyte death is eventually followed by bone resorption
[8], [21], [22]; however, apoptotic and necrotic death markers

can concomitantly be present in the same cell [23]; progression to
secondary necrosis could ensue in apoptotic osteocytes that are
protected in the bone from phagocytosis [24], [25]; molecules
that can elicit necrosis-induced immune signaling or inflamma-
tion are released from the plasma membrane during necrosis to
actively recruit a defensive or reparative response in regions that
have sustained damage [26]; and osteoclasts are highly regulated
to respond appropriately to inflammatory changes in their
microenvironment [27]. Thus, it is necessary to reconsider
whether bone resorption after osteocyte death is due to osteocyte
necrosis or to the function of osteocytes itself; however, the
anatomic sites of osteocytes, which are embedded in bone matrix,
and lack an appropriate in vitro system or animal model, have
made clarification of osteocyte functions difficult. Recently, the
involvement of osteocytes in osteoclastogenesis and bone resorp-
tion was reported using conditional knockout mice of b-catenin by
Dmp1-Cre, which resulted in enhanced bone resorption, and
conditional knockout mice of receptor activator of NF-kB ligand
(Rankl) by Dmp1-Cre, which resulted in osteopetrosis [28], [29],
[30].
We
generated
osteoblast-specific
BCL2
transgenic
mice.
Overexpression of BCL2 inhibited osteoblast maturation, and
the osteocytes, in which the transgene was down-regulated,
gradually died by apoptosis during bone development and
terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-
labeling (TUNEL)-positive lacunae accumulated in the bone [31].
As the level of transgene expression in osteoblasts was low and
TUNEL-positive lacunae were most accumulated at 4 months of
age, we considered that BCL2 transgenic mice at 4 months of age
might be an appropriate model for the evaluation of osteocyte
functions. To pursue the functions of the osteocyte network at
physiological and unloaded conditions, therefore, we investigated
how
destruction
of
the
osteocyte
network
had
influenced
osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and bone mass under physiological and
unloaded conditions using BCL2 transgenic mice at 4 months of
age.
Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
Prior to the study, all experiments were reviewed and approved
by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Nagasaki University
Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences. (Permit Number:
0906170767-4).
Animal Study
Two BCL2 transgenic mouse lines were established as previously
described [31], and BCL2 transgenic mouse line with low
expression was used in this paper. The serum level of osteocalcin
was examined using BTI Mouse Osteocalcin EIA kit (Biomedical
Technologies Inc., Stoughton, MA), and the serum level of
tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRAP5b) was examined
using the mouse TRAP Assay (Immunodiagnostic Systems,
Boldon, UK). At 6 weeks or 4 months of age, wild-type mice
and tg(L) were each divided into control and unloaded groups.
Unloading of the hind limbs was performed by tail suspension for
3–14 days in the unloaded group, while the mice in the control
group were normally loaded, as previously described [32]. After
tail suspension of the mice in the unloaded group, the mice in the
control and unloaded groups were immediately anesthetized and
sacrificed.
Cell Culture Experiments
Primary osteoblasts were isolated from newborn calvaria by
sequential digestion with 0.1% collagenase A and 0.2% dispase.
Osteoblastic cells from the third to fifth fraction were pooled and
used for osteoblast differentiation and osteoclastogenesis. To
examine osteoblast differentiation, staining for alkaline phospha-
tase (ALP) activity and mineralization was performed as previously
described [31]. The co-culture of primary osteoblasts and bone
marrow-derived monocyte/macrophage lineage cells (BMMs) was
performed as previously described [33].
Micro-CT Analysis
Dissected femurs at 6 weeks, 10 weeks, 4 months, or 6 months of
age were analyzed by a micro-CT system (mCT-20; Scanco
Medical, Bru¨ttisellen, Switzerland). Data from scanned slices were
used for three-dimensional analysis to calculate femoral morpho-
metric parameters. Trabecular bone parameters were measured
using the distal femoral metaphysis. Approximately 2.4 mm
(0.5 mm from the growth plate) was cranio-caudally scanned
and 200 slices were taken at 12 mm intervals. Cortical thickness
was measured at the mid-diaphyses of femurs. We used a threshold
value of 275 to binarize the spongiosa and cortex in wild-type and
BCL2 transgenic mice at all ages.
Histological Analysis
For histological analyses of the long bones, mice were sacrificed
and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/0.01M phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS), and the long bones were decalcified in 10% EDTA
(pH7.4) and embedded in paraffin. For Goland-Yoshiki method to
detect osteoid, the long bones were refixed with Cyanuric Chloride
before decalcification. Sections (3–7 mm thick) were stained with
hematoxylin and eosin (H–E), stained for TRAP activity, or
subjected to immunohistochemistry using monoclonal anti-human

Real-time RT-PCR and Western Blot Analyses
Muscle, connective tissue, and periosteum were removed from
femurs and tibiae, and the bones were cut at the metaphyses. After
hematopoieticcellsinthediaphysesoffemursandtibiaewereflushed
out with PBS, osteoblast-enriched cells were collected using a micro-
intertooth brush (Kobayashi Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Osaka,
Japan). The remaining bone was used as a source of osteocyte-
enriched cells. At the beginning of each experiment, nearly complete
removal of osteoblasts from the endosteum by the micro-intertooth
brush was confirmed using a scanning electron microscope
(Miniscope TM-1000; Hitachi) (Fig. S1). Total RNA was extracted
using ISOGEN (Wako, Osaka, Japan), and real-time RT-PCR was
performed using the following primers as previously described [35].

Results
The Effects of BCL2 Transgene in Osteoblast
Differentiation and Osteoclastogenesis
We established two lines of human BCL2 transgenic mice
under the control of mouse 2.3 kb Col1a1 promoter with
different expression levels, and both lines showed osteocyte
apoptosis probably due to the reduced osteocyte processes [31].
The transgenic line with low expression of BCL2 was used to
analyze the effect of osteocyte death, because the functions of
osteoblasts in these mice were less affected by the transgene
than those in the transgenic line with high BCL2 expression
[31]. The bone formation rate and osteoid thickness were
reduced in the transgenic line with high BCL2 expression but
not the transgenic line with low BCL2 expression at 10 weeks of
age (Figure S2) [31]. However, the function of osteoblasts in the
transgenic line with low BCL2 expression was mildly impaired
at 10 weeks of age, because the bone volume and bone
formation
rate
were
similar
to
those
in
wild-type
mice
irrespective of the increased osteoblast density, while the
osteoclastogenesis was normal (Table 1) [31]. In osteoblast
differentiation in vitro, primary osteoblasts from the transgenic
line with low BCL2 expression showed similar levels of ALP
activity and mineralization compared with those from wild-type
mice (Fig. 1A), although primary osteoblasts from the trans-
genic line with high BCL2 expression showed lower ALP
activity and mineralization compared with those from wild-type
mice [31]. We also examined osteoclast differentiation by co-
culturing primary osteoblasts and BMMs. The number of
TRAP-positive cells and the resorption area were similar
between
the
co-culture
of
primary
osteoblasts
from
the
transgenic line with low BCL2 expression and wild-type BMMs
and the co-culture of wild-type primary osteoblasts and BMMs
(Fig. 1B–E). Further, we previously showed that retroviral
introduction of BCL2 into wild-type primary osteoblasts had no
effect on osteoclastogenesis in the co-culture with wild-type
bone marrow cells [31].
Osteocyte Apoptosis in the Transgenic Line with Low
BCL2 Expression
The transgene expression was dependent on age; it was high in
mice at 2 weeks of age, but it gradually fell during growth and
was low in mice at 4–6 months of age (Fig. 2A). The change in
the expression level of the transgene during aging was similar to
those of Col1a1 in wild-type mice (Fig. 2B). In immunohisto-
chemical analysis using anti-human BCL2 antibody, which reacts
on human BCL2 but not mouse Bcl2, the transgene expression
relative levels are shown in A. The value at 4 months of age was defined as 1, and relative levels are shown in B. (C–J) Immunohistochemical analysis.
Sections of wild-type mice at 2 weeks of age (C) and BCL2 transgenic mice at 2 weeks (E), 6 weeks (G), and 4 months (I) of age were reacted with anti-
BCL2 antibody. Boxed regions in C, E, G, and I are magnified in D, F, H, and J, respectively. The arrows in H indicate immature osteocytes, which
expressed the transgene. The lacunae, which were TUNEL-positive and contained cellular debris of dead osteocytes, were non-specifically reacted
with anti-BCL2 antibody in BCL2 transgenic mice. Scale bars = 100 mm (C, E, G, I); 10 mm (D, F, H, J). (K) The number of osteocytes in cortical bone. The

was strongly detected in osteoblasts and mildly in most of
osteocytes at 2 weeks of age (Fig. 2C–F). At 6 weeks of age, the
transgene expression was also strongly detected in osteoblasts, but
its expression in osteocytes was restricted to immature osteocytes,
which were located near the surface of cortical bone (Fig. 2G, H).
At 4 months of age, the transgene expression was still clearly
detected in osteoblasts but undetectable in osteocytes (Fig. 2I, J).
The numbers of osteocytes were increased in BCL2 transgenic
mice compared with wild-type mice in both cortical and
trabecular bone until 10 weeks of age probably due to the
increase of osteoblast density, whereas they were reduced in BCL2
transgenic mice compared with wild-type mice in both cortical
and trabecular bone at 4 months of age (Figs. 2K, 3B) (Table 1)
[31]. Unexpectedly, TUNEL-positive lacunae accumulated dur-
ing aging. About 1% of lacunae in the cortical bone at the
diaphyses of femurs were TUNEL-positive in wild-type mice
from 5 weeks to 8 months of age, whereas the corresponding
percentage in BCL2 transgenic mice was about 20% at 5–6 weeks
of age, about 50% at 10 weeks of age, about 75% at 4 months of
age, and about 50% at 8 months of age (Figs. 2L and 3). After the
death of osteocytes, the lacunae contained only cellular debris but
TUNEL reactivity was retained in the lacunae (Fig. 3), because
the debris of dead osteocytes cannot be eliminated until the
surrounding bone is resorbed [22], [36]. At 6–8 months of age,
the cortical bone in BCL2 transgenic mice was partly remodeled
and the remodeled bone contained osteocytes with a normal
appearance,
probably
due
to
the
reduction
in
transgene
expression (Fig. 3K–P).
Bone canalicular staining showed that the severity in the
disturbance of osteocyte network was different depending on
the age in BCL2 transgenic mice. Osteocyte network was
disturbed at the center but not at the periphery of cortical bone
at 10 weeks of age, it was disturbed in the whole area of
cortical bone at 4 months of age, and the disturbance was
restricted to the inner half of cortical bone at 8 months of age
(Figures S3, S4, S5). The reduction in the number of canaliculi
was observed in trabecular bone as well as cortical bone of
BCL2 transgenic mice until 4 months of age (Figures S3, S4,
S5, S6) [31].
We also examined the frequency of TUNEL-positive lacunae in
trabecular bone. About 1% of lacunae in the trabecular bone of
femurs were TUNEL-positive in wild-type mice from 6 weeks to 4
months of age, whereas the corresponding percentage in BCL2
transgenic mice was 3% at 6 weeks of age, 7% at 10 weeks of age,
and 16% at 4 months of age (Fig. 2M).
These findings showed that the transgene expression was low in
osteoblasts and barely detectable in osteocytes, the number of
osteocytes was reduced, the frequency of TUNEL-positive lacunae
peaked, and osteocyte network was most severely disturbed at 4
months of age in BCL2 transgenic mice. Thus, we focused on
BCL2 transgenic mice at 4 months of age to evaluate bone
phenotypes after the accumulation of TUNEL-positive lacunae,
while minimizing the effects of BCL2 on osteoblasts and
osteocytes.
Increase in Bone Formation and Reduced Number of
Osteoclasts in Cortical Bone of BCL2 Transgenic Mice
after the Accumulation of TUNEL-positive Lacunae
At 10 weeks of age, cortical thickness and total tissue volume at
the mid-diaphyses of femurs in BCL2 transgenic mice were similar
to those in wild-type mice, but bone marrow volume in BCL2
transgenic mice was less than that in wild-type mice. At 4 months
of age, however, the cortical thickness and total tissue volume but
not bone marrow volume had increased in BCL2 transgenic mice
but not in wild-type mice compared with at 10 weeks of age,
indicating that cortical bone was enlarged due to the acquisition of
bone in the periosteum (Fig. 4A, B). On dynamic bone
histomorphometric analysis, the double-labeled surface and bone
formation rate were increased in the periosteum but not in the
endosteum of the cortical bone of femurs of BCL2 transgenic mice
compared with the respective parameter in wild-type mice at 4
months of age (Fig. 4C–G), indicating that the osteoblast function
was enhanced in the periosteum. Further, the serum level of
osteocalcin, which is a serum marker of bone formation, was
increased in BCL2 transgenic mice compared with wild-type mice
at 4 months of age (Fig. 4H). In histological analysis, osteoid was
thick in cortical bone of BCL2 transgenic mice compared with
wild-type mice at 4 months of age (Fig. 5A–D, I). However, the
cortical thickness was not significantly different between wild-type
and BCL2 transgenic mice at 6 months of age (Fig. 4A, B). These
findings suggest that cortical thickness increased in parallel with
the reduction in the numbers of osteocytes and the accumulation
of TUNEL-positive lacunae.
Next, we examined bone resorption in BCL2 transgenic mice
by counting multinucleated TRAP-positive cells at 2, 5–6, and 10
weeks and 4 months of age, and by measuring the serum level of
TRAP5b, which is a serum marker of bone resorption, at 4
months of age (Fig. 6). The number of osteoclasts in the
periosteum of femurs was similar between wild-type mice and
BCL2 transgenic mice at all ages examined. In the endosteum,
the number of osteoclasts in BCL2 transgenic mice was increased
compared with in wild-type mice at 2 weeks of age, whereas the
number of osteoclasts in the endosteum in BCL2 transgenic mice
was lower than in wild-type mice at 5–6 weeks, 10 weeks and 4
months of age (Fig. 6A–E). In accordance with these findings,
bone marrow volume was reduced in BCL2 transgenic mice
compared with wild-type mice at 10 weeks of age (Fig. 4B).
Further, the serum level of TRAP5b was lower in BCL2
transgenic mice than in wild-type mice at 4 months of age
(Fig.
6F).
These
findings
suggest
that
the
reduction
in
osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption occurred in cortical bone
in parallel with the reduction in the number of osteocytes and
the accumulation of TUNEL-positive lacunae. Serum levels of
calcium and phosphate were similar between wild-type mice and
BCL2 transgenic mice at 4 months of age (calcium: wild-type
mice 8.1660.24 mg/dl, BCL2 transgenic mice 8.3960.54 mg/dl;
phosphate: wild-type mice 9.761.39 mg/dl, BCL2 transgenic
mice 10.860.97 mg/dl, n = 4–5).

Trabecular Bone of BCL2 Transgenic Mice was Increased
Due to Enhanced Bone Formation through Augmented
Osteoblast Function at 4 Months of Age
On micro-CT analysis, trabecular bone volume, trabecular
number, and trabecular thickness were increased in BCL2
transgenic mice (control group) compared with wild-type mice
(control group) at 4 months of age (Figs. 7A, B), although these
parameters in BCL2 transgenic mice were similar to those in
wild-type mice at 10 weeks of age [31]. Bone histomorphometric
analysis of trabecular bone showed that the increase in bone
volume
was
due
to
enhanced
bone
formation
through
augmented osteoblast function, because osteoblast number,
osteoclast number, and eroded surface were similar between
wild-type mice and BCL2 transgenic mice, but the parameters
for
bone
formation,
including
osteoid
thickness,
mineral
apposition rate, double-labeled surface, and bone formation
rate, were increased in BCL2 transgenic mice compared with
wild-type mice, indicating that the trabecular bone of BCL2
transgenic mice was increased due to enhanced bone formation
through augmented osteoblast function at 4 months of age
(Table 1). Osteoid was apparently increased in trabecular bone
of BCL2 transgenic mice compared with wild-type mice at 4
months of age (Fig. 5E–I). However, osteoblast function was
mildly impaired in BCL2 transgenic mice at 10 weeks of age as
shown by the increased osteoblast density but normal level of
bone formation (Table 1) [31].
No Reduction in Bone Mass at the Unloaded Condition in
BCL2 Transgenic Mice at 4 Months of Age
To further investigate the effect of the accumulation of
TUNEL-positive lacunae, we performed tail suspension to
generate an unloaded condition in the hind limbs using BCL2
transgenic mice at 4 months of age and analyzed the femurs by
micro-CT (Figs. 7A, B). Bone volume and trabecular thickness
were reduced in the femurs of wild-type mice after unloading,
whereas these parameters were unchanged in the femurs of
BCL2 transgenic mice after unloading (Fig. 7B). Bone histo-
morphometric analysis showed that the reduction in bone
volume after unloading in wild-type mice at 4 months of age was
mainly due to enhanced osteoclastogenesis, as indicated by
increases in the osteoclast number and eroded surface, and
partly due to reduced osteoblast function, as indicated by the
decrease in osteoid thickness (Fig. 7C). In contrast, the
parameters of both bone formation and bone resorption were
unchanged in BCL2 transgenic mice at 4 months of age after
unloading. In accordance with the bone histomorphometric
data, the expression of Ctsk was increased in the unloaded group
compared with the control group in wild-type mice but not in
BCL2 transgenic mice, indicating that osteoclastogenesis was
enhanced at unloading in wild-type mice but not in BCL2
transgenic mice (Fig. 7D).
Upregulation of Rankl Expression in Osteoblasts after
Unloading in Wild-type Mice but not in BCL2 Transgenic
Mice
We
prepared
osteoblast-enriched
samples
and
osteocyte-
enriched samples as described in the Materials and methods.
We first compared the expression of Dmp1, Sost, Phex, Fgf23, and
Mepe, which are highly expressed in osteocytes [37], between the
osteoblast-enriched
samples
and
osteocyte-enriched
samples
prepared from wild-type mice at 4 months of age (Fig. 8A). Sost
expression was specifically detected in the osteocyte fractions,
Mepe expression was significantly high in the osteocyte fractions,
and the levels of Dmp1 and Fgf23 expression were marginally high
in the osteocyte fractions compared with the osteoblast fractions,
while Phex expression was similar in the osteoblast and osteocyte
fractions.
Although
we
previously
reported
that
Dmp1
is
expressed in osteocytes [38], Dmp1 expression was also detected
in the osteoblast fractions, because Dmp1 was detected in
osteoblasts, which are going to be embedded in the bone matrix,
as well as osteocytes by immunohistochemistry (unpublished
data). The expressions of these genes in individual osteocyte,
which remained to be alive in BCL2 transgenic mice, were
examined using the osteocyte fractions. These expressions in the
osteocyte fractions of BCL2 transgenic mice were comparable to
those in wild-type mice at 4 months of age (Fig. 8B). We also
compared the expression of the genes, which were dominantly
expressed in osteoblasts, between osteoblast-enriched samples and
osteocyte-enriched samples to examine their purity. Keratocan was
specifically detected in osteoblast-enriched samples as previously
reported [39]. The expressions of Runx2, Osterix, Col1a1, and
osteocalcin were also significantly higher in osteoblast-enriched
samples than osteocyte enriched samples (Fig. 8C).
After unloading, Rankl expression in osteoblasts was upregu-
lated in wild-type mice but not in BCL2 transgenic mice at 4
months of age (Fig. 8D). Further, the Rankl expression was
significantly lower in BCL2 transgenic mice in the unloaded
condition compared with that in wild-type mice in the control
condition (Fig. 8D). The expression of Osteoprotegerin (Opg) in
osteoblasts was not affected by unloading in either wild-type mice
or BCL2 transgenic mice at 4 months of age (Fig. 8D). As Rankl is
expressed in osteocytes as well as osteoblasts [40], we compared
the expression levels of Rankl and Opg between osteoblast and
osteocyte fractions from wild-type mice at 4 months of age
(Fig. 8E). Both Rankl and Opg expressions were high in the
osteocyte fractions compared with the osteoblast fractions.
However, unloading had no significant effect on the expression
of Rankl and Opg in the osteocyte fractions of both wild-type and
BCL2 transgenic mice at 4 months of age (Fig. 8F).
Wnt antagonists play an important role in bone formation
[19], [41], [42]. Thus, we also examined the expression of the
genes whose proteins antagonize Wnt signaling in osteocyte
fractions (Fig. 8G). Dkk1 and sFRP1 expression was high and
sFRP5 expression was low in BCL2 transgenic mice compared
with wild-type mice in the control groups. Dkk1 was down-

regulated after unloading in wild-type mice but not in BCL2
transgenic mice, and sFRP5 was down-regulated after unloading
in both wild-type and BCL2 transgenic mice. Unloading had no
significant effect on the expression of Sost, sFRP1, sFRP2, and
sFRP4 in both wild-type and BCL2 transgenic mice at 4 months of
age.
Increase of Sost-positive Osteocytes in the Restricted
Region of Tibiae after Unloading in Wild-type Mice but
not in BCL2 Transgenic Mice
The reduction in bone formation in response to unloading is
abrogated in Sost2/2 mice, and Sost mRNA but not Sost-positive
osteocytes is increased after unloading [20], [43]. Further, the
down-regulation of Sost after loading is dependent on the site in
tibiae [44]. Therefore, we examined the expression of Sost on the
anterior and posterior sides of cortical bone at the metaphysis and
mid-diaphysis of tibiae by immunohistochemistry at 4 months of
age (Fig. 9A–D). As the lacunae, which were TUNEL-positive
and contained cellular debris of dead osteocytes, were non-
specifically reacted with anti-Sost antibody in BCL2 transgenic
mice, we counted only the lacunae containing the cells with a
nucleus in both wild-type and BCL2 transgenic mice. On both
sides of cortical bone at metaphysis and the anterior side of
cortical bone at mid-diaphysis, the frequencies of Sost-positive
cells were similar among wild-type and BCL2 transgenic mice of
both control and unloaded groups (Fig. 9K–M). On the posterior
side of cortical bone at mid-diaphysis, however, the frequency
was increased in the unloaded group compared with the control
group in wild-type mice, while it was similar in both groups in
BCL2 transgenic mice (Fig. 9E–H, N). Further, Sost protein was
distributed through the canaliculi throughout bone in wild-type

mice but not in BCL2 transgenic mice probably due to the
reduction
in
the
number
of
osteocyte
processes
and
the
accumulation of dead osteocytes in BCL2 transgenic mice
(Fig. 9G–J).
As the distribution of Sost protein was interrupted in BCL2
transgenic mice at 4 months of age, we compared the protein
levels of b-catenin in the osteoblast fractions between wild-type
and BCL2 transgenic mice at 4 months of age by Western blot
analysis. b-catenin protein was increased in BCL2 transgenic mice
compared with wild-type mice, suggesting that Wnt signaling was
enhanced in osteoblasts of BCL2 transgenic mice at 4 months of
age (Fig. 9O).
Reduction in Bone Mass in the Unloaded Condition in
BCL2 Transgenic Mice at 6 Weeks of Age
We
analyzed
the
characteristics
of
osteocytes
and
the
responsiveness to unloading in BCL2 transgenic mice at 6 weeks
of age, when the number of osteocytes was increased but
TUNEL-positive lacunae were not accumulated (Figs. 2L, 2M,
3B, 3D). On real-time RT-PCR using RNA from osteocyte-
enriched samples at 6 weeks of age, Dmp1 expression was
increased, Fgf23 expression was decreased, and Sost, Phex, and
Mepe
were
similarly
expressed
in
BCL2
transgenic
mice
compared with in wild-type mice (Fig. 10A). Serum levels of
calcium and phosphate were similar between wild-type mice
and BCL2 transgenic mice at 6 weeks of age (calcium: wild-type
mice 8.5860.43 mg/dl, BCL2 transgenic mice 8.6660.49 mg/
dl; phosphate: wild-type mice 11.8560.79 mg/dl, BCL2 trans-
genic mice 11.2460.9 mg/dl, n
= 5–8). In the unloaded
condition, bone volume and trabecular thickness were reduced
in the femurs of both wild-type mice and BCL2 transgenic mice
at a similar degree (Fig. 10B, C). After unloading, Rankl
expression in osteoblasts was marginally increased in both wild-
type mice and BCL2 transgenic mice with less response in the
latter at 6 weeks of age. Opg expression in osteoblasts was similar
between wild-type mice and BCL2 transgenic mice, and was not
affected by unloading (Fig. 10D). The Rankl expression in
osteocytes was reduced after unloading for 3days in both wild-
type and BCL2 transgenic mice, while unloading had no effect
on Opg expression in osteocytes (Fig. 10E). Sost expression in
osteocytes was upregulated after unloading significantly in wild-
type mice and marginally in BCL2 transgenic mice at 6 weeks of
age (Fig. 10E).
Discussion
Unexpectedly, overexpression of BCL2 in osteoblasts led to
the reduction in the number of osteocyte processes, which
seemed to be one of the causes of osteocyte apoptosis in BCL2
transgenic mice [31]. Thus, we examined the effects of osteocyte
apoptosis and the reductions in the numbers of osteocytes and
their processes on bone formation and resorption using BCL2
transgenic mice at 4 months of age, when TUNEL-positive
lacunae were most accumulated, the number of osteocytes was
reduced, and osteocyte network was most severely disturbed, but
the expression of transgene was reduced, to minimize the effects
of the transgene on osteoblasts and osteocytes. We found that
osteoblast function was enhanced and osteoclastogenesis was
inhibited in BCL2 transgenic mice at 4 months of age. These
findings suggest that disruption of the osteocyte network might
be related to the enhancement of osteoblast function and the
suppression of osteoclastogenesis. In the unloaded condition,
osteoblast function was inhibited and osteoclastogenesis was
enhanced, leading to bone loss in wild-type mice, whereas
osteoblast function and osteoclastogenesis were unaffected,
leading to the maintenance of bone mass in BCL2 transgenic
mice at 4 months of age. Further, Sost expression in osteocytes
and Rankl expression in osteoblasts were upregulated in wild-
type mice but not in BCL2 transgenic mice in the unloaded
condition. Thus, we propose that the osteocyte network inhibits
osteoblast function and stimulates osteoclastogenesis in the
physiological condition, and that osteocytes further augment the
inhibitory effects on osteoblast function through the induction of
Sost in osteocytes and the stimulatory effect on osteoclastogen-
esis through the induction of Rankl in osteoblasts in the unloaded
condition (Fig. 11).
In contrast to the general consensus that osteocyte death triggers
bone remodeling by enhancing bone resorption [8], [21], [22],
osteoclastogenesis was enhanced in parallel with an increase in
osteocyte density, and osteoclastogenesis was reduced in parallel
with the accumulation of dead osteocytes; therefore, our findings
suggest that osteocytes stimulate osteoclastogenesis in the physi-
ological condition. The enhanced bone resorption after osteocyte
death in previous observations may have been caused by the
stimulation of osteoclastogenesis through an inflammatory reac-
tion in the microenvironment, which would be elicited by the
elimination of inflammation-inducible molecules from lacunae
through canaliculi when necrotic aspects appear in the cell death
of osteocytes that are not phagocytosed [26]. In BCL2 transgenic
mice, however, the reduction in the number of canaliculi and the

gradual accumulation of TUNEL-positive lacunae may have
limited the release of the inflammation-inducible molecules from
lacunae through canaliculi after secondary necrosis, as shown in
the immunostaining of Sost (Fig. 9H, J).
We pursued the mechanism of the enhanced bone resorption
in the unloaded condition. Rankl and Opg were highly expressed
in osteocyte fractions. Although the upregulation of Rankl
expression in osteocytes at unloaded condition was reported
[29],
both
Rankl
and
Opg
expressions
in
osteocytes
were
unaffected
by
unloading.
In
contrast,
Rankl
but
not
Opg
expression was upregulated in osteoblast fractions by unloading
in wild-type mice but not in BCL2 transgenic mice. These
findings suggest that the osteocyte network senses unloading and
transfers
unknown
signals
to
osteoblasts
to
induce
Rankl
expression in osteoblasts. We found that pyruvate dehydroge-
nase kinase 4 (Pdk4), which is a negative regulator of pyruvate
dehydrogenase complex, is upregulated at unloading and is one
of the molecules that induce Rankl expression in osteoblasts at
the unloaded condition [33]. As soluble factors released from
MLO-Y4 regulate osteoclastogenesis [45], [46], osteocytes may
release soluble factors to upregulate the expression of Pdk4 and
Rankl in osteoblasts. As our findings suggest that the osteocyte
network stimulates osteoclastogenesis in the physiological condi-
tion, Opg, which was highly expressed in osteocytes, may be
trapped by Rankl on the surface of osteocytes. The conditional
deletion of Rankl using Dmp1 promoter-Cre transgenic mice has
been shown to result in the reduction in bone resorption and
increase in bone mass [30], [47]. It may indicate that Opg,
which was highly expressed in osteocytes, is secreted to the bone
surface through canaliculi in the absence of Rankl on the
surface of osteocytes.
The
function
of
osteocytes
in
bone
formation
in
the
physiological condition has been controversial. Acute death of
osteocytes by diphtheria toxin severely reduces bone formation
[8], while osteocyte density is negatively correlated with bone
formation [10], [11]. As both empty lacunar density and
periosteal bone apposition increase with age, a link between the
two phenomena has been suggested [48], [49], [50], [51], [52].
Furthermore, mice carrying a targeted mutation of Col1a1,
encoding a collagenase-resistant form of type I collagen, showed
osteocyte apoptosis and increased bone formation [53], and it
has been shown that osteocytes secrete Sost, which is a potent
antagonist of Wnt, and inhibits bone formation [54], [55], [56],
[57];
therefore,
there
were
contrasting
observations
that
osteocytes can enhance or inhibit bone formation. Bone
formation in both trabecular and cortical bones was enhanced
in BCL2 transgenic mice at 4 months of age when the transgene
expression
was
low,
TUNEL-positive
lacunae
were
most
accumulated, osteocyte number was reduced, and osteocyte
network was disturbed in the whole area of cortical bone.
Although we cannot exclude the possibility that the expression
of the transgene at the low level promoted bone formation at 4
months of age, this seemed to be unlikely because overexpres-
sion of BCL2 impaired osteoblast differentiation in a manner
dependent on the expression levels of the transgene in vivo and
in vitro (Fig. 1A) [31], osteoblast density was similar between
BCL2 transgenic mice and wild-type mice at 4 months of age,
and cortical bone in BCL2 transgenic mice was not further
increased at 6 months of age irrespective of the similar level of
transgene expression at 4 and 6 months of age. The disturbed
osteocyte network was gradually restored after 4 months of age,
probably because the level of the transgene expression was not
sufficient to reduce the number of osteocyte processes. These
seemed to be the reasons why the enhanced bone formation was
observed only at 4 months of age. Thus, our findings suggest
that the reductions in the numbers of osteocytes and their
processes and the accumulation of TUNEL-positive lacunae
were followed by the activation of osteoblast function, leading to
an increase in bone formation. As the distribution of Sost
protein was interrupted in osteocytes and b-catenin protein was
increased in osteoblasts in BCL2 transgenic mice at 4 months of
age, the activation of Wnt signaling in osteoblasts by the
reduction of disseminated Sost protein seems to be one of the
causes for the increase in bone formation in BCL2 transgenic
mice at 4 months of age. In mice with osteocyte ablation by
diphtheria toxin, the suppression of bone formation seemed to
be due to maturational inhibition of osteoblasts, which was
shown by the reduction in osteocalcin expression [8], and
maturational inhibition may have been caused by a necrosis-
induced inflammatory reaction.
The frequencies of TUNEL-positive lacunae in the trabec-
ular bone of BCL2 transgenic mice were less than those in the
cortical bone, probably because trabecular bone is more
extensively
remodeled
than
cortical
bone
and
the
dead
osteocytes in the trabecular bone are rapidly replaced with live
osteocytes. Irrespective of the relatively low frequency of
TUNEL-positive
lacunae,
however,
the
increase
of
bone
formation and unresponsive to unloading were observed in
the trabecular bone at 4 months of age. Therefore, the
reduction in the number of osteocyte processes in addition to
the reduction in the number of osteocytes may be sufficient for
the disturbance of osteocyte network in trabecular bone. The
number of osteoclasts was reduced in the cortical bone but not
in the trabecular bone of BCL2 transgenic mice at 4 months of
age. It may indicate that osteoclastogenesis in cortical bone is
more dependent on the osteocyte network than that in
trabecular bone, because the number of osteoclasts was already
reduced in the cortical bone in BCL2 transgenic mice at 5–6

boxed regions with asterisks in A–D are magnified in E–G, respectively. The boxed regions in G and H are magnified in I and J, respectively. In
F and H, closed arrows indicate Sost-positive osteocytes and open arrows indicate Sost-negative osteocytes. The lacunae with cellular debris
in BCL2 transgenic mice were non-specifically stained with Sost antibody (F, H). The sections were counterstained with methylgreen. Note
that Sost is distributed through canaliculi throughout bone in wild-type mice but not in BCL2 transgenic mice (I, J). Scale bars = 0.5 mm (A–D);
50 mm (E–H); 10 mm (I, J). (K–N) Frequency of Sost-positive cells in cortical bone. Sost-positive cells were counted in the anterior (K, M) and

using male wild-type mice [control group, 7 mice; unloaded group, 9 mice] and BCL2 transgenic mice [control group, 9 mice; unloaded group,
8 mice] at 4 months of age. The number of Sost-positive osteocytes was presented as a percentage of the total number of osteocytes. Only

weeks of age, when the frequency of TUNEL-positive lacunae
was about 20%, an equivalent value detected in the trabecular
bone at 4 months of age. The augmented function of the
osteocyte network by unloading may be required for the
enhancement of osteoclastogenesis by the osteocyte network in
trabecular bone.
Our model also may explain why exercise increases bone mass,
which has been indicated by many clinical studies [58], because
osteocytes decrease the inhibitory effects on bone mass by
reducing the inhibitory effect on osteoblast function and the
stimulatory effect on osteoclastogenesis in the loaded condition
(physiological condition) compared with the unloaded condition
(Fig. 11). Our findings suggest that the osteocyte network is a
mechanosensor and mechanotransduction system that reduces its
negative effects on bone mass by responding to mechanical stress,
explaining how bone mass increases with exercise and decreases
with bed rest. Our BCL2 transgenic mice was also a useful tool to
search the molecular targets of disuse osteoporosis, because we
found that Pdk4 is responsible for bone loss at unloading by
comparing the genes induced in wild-type mice and BCL2
transgenic mice at 4 months of age in the unloaded condition [33].
Our findings will provide a basis for understanding the osteocyte
network, which plays an important role in the regulation of bone
mass.

Figure 11. A model of osteocyte functions. (A) In the loaded
(physiological) condition, the osteocyte network inhibits osteoblast
function, enhances osteoclastogenesis, and negatively regulates bone
mass. (B) In the unloaded condition, the effect of osteocyte network on
osteoblast function is augmented through the induction of Sost in
osteocytes and that on osteoclastogenesis is augmented through the
induction of Rankl in osteoblasts, resulting in reduced bone mass. The
thickness of the lines and arrows in A and B reflects the strength of the
effects.
