Abstract
Previous epidemiologic data demonstrate that cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality may occur decades after ionizing
radiation exposure. With increased use of proton and carbon ion radiotherapy and concerns about space radiation
exposures to astronauts on future long-duration exploration-type missions, the long-term effects and risks of low-dose
charged particle irradiation on the CV system must be better appreciated. Here we report on the long-term effects of whole-
body proton (1H; 0.5 Gy, 1 GeV) and iron ion (56Fe; 0.15 Gy, 1GeV/nucleon) irradiation with and without an acute myocardial
ischemia (AMI) event in mice. We show that cardiac function of proton-irradiated mice initially improves at 1 month but
declines by 10 months post-irradiation. In AMI-induced mice, prior proton irradiation improved cardiac function restoration
and enhanced cardiac remodeling. This was associated with increased pro-survival gene expression in cardiac tissues. In
contrast, cardiac function was significantly declined in 56Fe ion-irradiated mice at 1 and 3 months but recovered at 10
months. In addition, 56Fe ion-irradiation led to poorer cardiac function and more adverse remodeling in AMI-induced mice,
and was associated with decreased angiogenesis and pro-survival factors in cardiac tissues at any time point examined up
to 10 months. This is the first study reporting CV effects following low dose proton and iron ion irradiation during normal
aging and post-AMI. Understanding the biological effects of charged particle radiation qualities on the CV system is
necessary both for the mitigation of space exploration CV risks and for understanding of long-term CV effects following
charged particle radiotherapy.

Introduction
Previous epidemiologic data in radiotherapy patients [1–3],
non-occupational exposure [4–6] and occupational exposure for
ionizing radiation (IR)-induced cardiovascular (CV) diseases
demonstrate that CV morbidity may occur within months or
years, and CV mortality may occur within decades, after initial IR
exposure. Most of what we know about harmful effects of IR on
CV system is from terrestrial epidemiological studies of patients
who are long-term survivors of conventional (X-ray or electron-
based) [1–3] but not charged particle (protons, carbon ions) cancer
radiotherapy (RT). The specific cause and effect relationship of IR
effects on increased incidence of CV disease was reported in post-
operative left- vs. right-sided RT, where left-sided RT was
associated with 44% higher risk of death from CV disease
compared to right-sided RT [1,2]. In these procedures, equivalent
single dose to the heart was determined to be 1–2 Gy, thus similar
to the heart doses in the A-bomb survivors who developed fatal
IR-induced CV disease decades after exposure [6]. A more recent
epidemiologic study of 2,168 women who underwent conventional
RT for breast cancer between 1958 and 2001 in Europe has
shown that the rate of major coronary events increased linearly
with the mean dose to the heart by 7.4% per Gy, with no apparent
lower or upper threshold (overall average of the mean doses to the
whole heart was 4.9 Gy, range 20.03 to 27.72 Gy) [7].
The effects of solar and galactic cosmic irradiation during and
after space flights on the cardiovascular (CV) system are unknown.
The majority of space flight-associated CV risks identified to date
were determined shortly after low Earth orbit (LEO) International
Space Station (ISS) flights, and include serious cardiac dysrhyth-
mias, compromised orthostatic CV response, manifestation of

previously asymptomatic CV disease and cardiac atrophy [8–10].
There is limited and sporadic epidemiologic data for long-term
CV morbidity and mortality of US astronauts involved with the
Mercury, Skylab, Shuttle and International Space Station (ISS)
programs. In August 2013, the complete list of deceased US
astronauts was released to public, including the cause of death, age
and specific space program(s) participation. While limited, these
data implicate heart attack as the second leading cause of death
(after non-flight accidents) in astronauts who participated in the
Apollo 11, 12, and 14–17 Moon missions. It appears that in later
Shuttle and ISS programs, cancer is the second leading cause of
death in US astronauts after flight and non-flight-related accidents.
In order to better determine IR-induced CV risks associated with
space travel beyond LEO, studies are performed at ground-based
accelerator facilities which approximate the space radiation
environment to determine proton and heavy ion effects in relevant
in vitro and in vivo model systems. Such studies are essential to
improve predictive risk models, as well as developing appropriate
diagnostic tests and potential countermeasures.
During future Moon, near Earth asteroids or Mars missions,
astronauts will be exposed to higher total doses (,0.4–0.5 Gy)
from galactic cosmic rays (GCR), especially during Mars missions
that are currently estimated to be 22–32 months [9]. Measure-
ments of the complex ionizing radiation environment inside the
Curiosity rover while in transit to Mars determined that the dose
equivalent for a short-duration roundtrip to be ,0.6660.12 Sv
[10]. It is estimated that during deep space missions, each cell in
an astronaut’s body will be traversed by a proton (1H) every three
days, a helium (2He) nucleus every few weeks, and high charge and
energy (HZE) nuclei (e.g., 12C, 16O, 28Si, 56Fe, etc.) every few
months [11]. In spite of the fact that only 1% of GCR is composed
of ions heavier than helium, approximately 41% of IR dose-
equivalent is predicted to be HZE particle-derived with 13% being
from 56Fe particles alone. This is due to the extremely high linear
energy transfer (LET; for iron tens to thousands of keV/mm in
water versus ,0.1–2 keV/mm for protons) and accompanying
relative biological effectiveness (RBE) values of iron ions compared
to protons [12]. The majority of astronauts are middle-aged
(average age of 46), and thus at a higher risk for CV disease
development [13]. During an exploration-class space mission to
Mars, astronauts will not have access to comprehensive health care
services for a period of at least 2 years [9,14].
With essentially no information available on the effects of low
dose charged particle IR on the CV system (i.e., heart), we
examined the effects of acute, whole-body proton and iron ion IR
on CV system alterations during normal aging and under induced
ischemic conditions. In addition, we studied key molecular and
cellular signaling pathways that may be responsible for these
alterations. We believe that our findings not only benefit future
NASA exploration-type space missions but also the general
population, specifically hadron (i.e., proton and fast neutron)
and heavy ion radiotherapy patients (e.g., carbon ions) [15], by
providing initial mechanistic insights for development of CV
morbidity and mortality due to charged particle irradiation.
To the best of our knowledge, no data are available on whether
or not charged particle IR may pose significant additive risks for
CV etiologies, or whether it impairs cardiac repair and regener-
ation processes following adverse CV events (e.g., AMI). We
report here, effects of charged particle IR typical of the space
radiation environment on CV function up to 10 months after
initial exposure in a mouse model with and without complication
by an induced ischemic event. We also measured IR-induced
changes in molecular and cellular pro-survival and angiogenesis
signaling pathways related to CV function and recovery after
AMI.
Materials and Methods
Animal models
Adult male C57Bl/6NT mice, 8–10 months of age (Taconic,
Germantown, NY) were shipped directly to Brookhaven National
Laboratory (BNL, Upton, NY). Mice were fed standard laboratory
chow diet (Harlan Teklad), were given water access ad libitum and
kept in the temperature- and light-controlled (12 hour light/dark
cycles) environment. All mice were handled in accordance with the
guidelines set and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committees (IACUC) at both GeneSys Research Institute
(GRI) and Brookhaven National Labs (BNL). Any animal in this
study found to exhibit severe or irreversible symptoms of pain and
stress (limited mobility, reduced consumption of food and water,
weight loss of 15% or more) was euthanized immediately by
Pentobarbital based euthanasia solution 200 mg/Kg intraperito-
neal (i.p). This method is consistent with the recommendation of
the Panel on Euthanasia of the American Veterinary Medical
Association Guidelines on Euthanasia.
Particle Radiation and Dosimetry
Whole-body exposures of mice to 1 GeV protons (1H;
LET = 0.223 keV/mm) and 1 GeV/nucleon (n) iron ions (56Fe;
LET = 151.4 keV/mm) were performed at the NASA Space
Radiation Laboratory at BNL according to standardized proce-
dures. Animals were placed individually into rectangular polysty-
rene boxes with multiple air holes (4 mm in diameter) and then
exposed to 50 cGy 1H or 15 cGy 56Fe ions in the Bragg plateau
region. These doses were chosen to be approximately equitoxic for
a variety of other relevant biological endpoints, assuming a RBE
value of 1 for 1 GeV protons and ,3 for 1 GeV/n 56Fe ions
(compared to gamma ray reference radiation). The average dose-
rate for the 1H and 56Fe irradiations was ,1665 cGy/min and
560.5 cGy/min respectively. Effective doses to the mouse heart
were estimated using NASA GERMcode (the GCR Event-based
Risk
Model)
Monte
Carlo-based
modeling
algorithm.
The
GERMcode provides information of primary ion and fragment
dose contributions as a function of distance into the target and
provide charged particle dosimetry results in excellent agreement
with physical NSRL Bragg curve measurements. One GeV/n 56Fe
ion exposures, doses to the mouse heart (assumed to be ,1 cm
from the skin surface) were calculated to be ,14.4 cGy with the
LET reduced to ,144 keV/micron (mm) at that position. For the
50 cGy 1 GeV proton exposures, the estimated heart dose would
be ,52.55 cGy and LET would be ,0.217 keV/(mm). Note that
GERMcode calculations reveal increased dose to the heart for
protons and decreased dose to the heart for 56Fe ions (due to their
differing fragmentation characteristics). Following irradiation, all
animals were driven to GeneSys Research Institute in Boston from
BNL for long-term housing and experimental analysis. Non-
irradiated control mice underwent identical procedures including
placement into polystyrene boxes and sham irradiation at NSRL.
Short and Long-term Experimental Groups
We evaluated the effect of single low-dose whole body 50 cGy
proton (1H) and 15 cGy, 1 GeV/n iron (56Fe) IR on the formation
and disappearance of p-H2AX phospo-S139 foci (p-H2AX foci
were evaluated up to 28 days post-IR, only), inflammation (CD68
staining) and oxidative DNA damage (8-oxo-de-oxy-Guanosine
ELISA) in the hearts of 8–10 months old (at the time of initial IR)
C57BL/6NT mice at various times up to 3 months post-IR. Each

group (1H, 56Fe and N-IR) consisted of n = 8 animals per time
point for short-term studies: 2 h, 5 h and 24 h and long-term
studies: 7 days, 14 days, 28 days, 2 months and 3 months.
Immunofluorescent Staining, Imaging and Analysis
DNA damage and repair.
To assess the formation and
decay of p-H2AX foci 6–8 mm section of OCT embedded heart
tissue from sham-irradiated, proton and 56Fe-ion-irradiated mice
collected at various times up to 28 days post-IR, were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 15 min at room temperature (RT)
and washed with 16phosphate buffered saline (16PBS) for 5 min.
Sections were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma, St.
Louis, MO) for 15 min at RT and washed three times in 16PBS
for 5 min. Primary anti-p-H2AX rabbit monoclonal antibody
(Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) and biotinylated
isolectin-B4 (ISB4 an EC-marker, Life Technologies, Grand
Island, NY) followed by Alexa-488 goat anti-rabbit secondary
antibody (Life Technologies) and Alexa-594 labeled streptavidin
(Life Technologies) were used respectively to assay p-H2AX foci
formation and decay over time in cardiac endothelial cells-ECs
(i.e., double positive for ISB4 and p-H2AX) and cardiac non-EC
cells (p-H2AX positive and ISB4 negative). Cardiac non-ECs may
represent cardiomyocytes (CM), cardiac fibroblasts and inflam-
matory cells. Topro-3 was used to visualize nuclei (Life Technol-
ogies). Images were obtained using laser scanning confocal
microscope (LSM 510 Meta, ZEISS, Thornwood, NY) at 10006
magnification. Cells with apoptotic features or micronuclei were
not considered for p-H2AX analysis. Data were obtained from
three replicate samples for sham-irradiated, proton and 56Fe ion-
irradiated cardiac tissues. Using a computer-assisted image
analysis algorithm based on pixel and color distribution the p-
H2AX foci were evaluated by quantifying all cells with $1 p-
H2AX foci. Graphs were plotted for mean foci/cell and for a
percent of cells with an N of p-H2AX foci.
Inflammation/Macrophages.
To evaluate inflammatory
infiltration the expression of CD68, a glycoprotein normally
expressed on macrophages, also known in mice as macrosialin was
quantified. Heart tissue sections from all three groups were
processed similarly as detailed above and stained with rat anti-
mouse CD68 monoclonal antibody (AbD Serotec, Raleigh, NC)
along with Alexa-488 goat anti-rat secondary antibody (Life
Technologies) and Topro-3. Images were obtained using laser
scanning confocal microscope at 6200 magnification.
Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for
Oxidative Damage
DNA extracts were obtained from sham-irradiated, proton and
56Fe-ion-irradiated mice heart tissue collected at various time
points up to 3 months post-IR using DNA isolation kit as per
manufacturer protocol (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Isolated DNA was
converted to single-stranded DNA and denatured to be processed
for 8-Oxo-de-oxy-Guanosine ELISA (Cell Biolabs Inc., San
Diego, CA) according to detailed manufacturer protocols (n = 3/
group/time point). The plates were read using Tecan Spectra
model 96 Well Microplate Reader (MTX Lab Systems, Vienna,
VA) using 450 nm primary wavelength.
Radiation+Aging (IR+Aging) Group
To evaluate the effects of a single low-dose full body IR in the
heart, we exposed 8–10 months old C57BL/6NT to 1H and 56Fe
IR and IR-induced alterations in cardiac function, tissue, cellular
and molecular changes in IR+Aging groups post-IR at 1, 3 and 10
months, were assessed by ECHO and HEMO, cardiac fibrosis by
Masson’s Trichrome and H&E staining and activation of signaling
pathways by protein analyses.
Radiation + Aging + AMI Group and Acute Myocardial
Infarct Surgery
We also evaluated the effect of low-dose whole-body acute 1H
and 56Fe ion irradiation in the hearts of 8–10 months old C57BL/
6NT over 10 months in an AMI model. AMI was induced by
ligation of LAD coronary artery 1, 3 and 10 months post-IR as
described before [16,17] and mice were monitored over 28 days
post-AMI by ECHO and before sacrificing HEMO measurements
were performed on day 28.
Cardiac Physiology
Echocardiography (ECHO).
After measurement of body
weight, animals were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane vaporized
in O2 (1.5–2%) at the rate of 1 L/min using a nose cone on a
warming pad. 2D guided M-mode ECHO was performed with a
15-MHz (15–6L) pediatric open heart surgery transducer (Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) as described before [18]. At least
5 sequential beats were analyzed (n = 6–8/group). Heart rate, LV
end diastolic diameter (EDD) and end systolic diameter (ESD) and
LV wall thickness were measured. LV ejection fraction (EF%) and
fractional
shortening
percent
(FS%)
were
calculated
using
standard
formulas
EF% = (EDV2ESV)/EDV6100
and
FS% = (EDD2EDS)/EDD6100.
Hemodynamic (HEMO).
In vivo LV pressure measure-
ments were performed by direct LV catheterization using Millar
Mikro-Tip Blood Pressure System (1.2F, SciSense, Ithaca, NY)
(n = 6–8/group) as described previously [18]. Heart rate, LV
systolic pressure (LVSP), LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), dP/
dtmax and dP/dtmin were recorded.
Histology, Imaging and Analysis
Routine Histology, H&E staining.
Sections (10 mm) of
formalin fixed paraffin embedded hearth tissue were stained with
H&E and visualized using a light microscope (Leica Microsystems,
Buffalo Grove, IL). Images of the full circumference of the heart
cross sections along with the infarct area post-AMI were taken at
6100 magnification and collaged.
IR-Induced Fibrosis, Masson’s Trichrome Staining.
To
determine whether low dose 1H- or 56Fe-IR could induce cardiac
fibrosis 1, 3 and 10 months post-IR, serial 10 mm sections of
cardiac tissue were processed for Masson’s Trichrome staining
(Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) and random regions
of the heart were imaged at 6200 (n = 20 images/sample per
group) to be analyzed using Image-J program (v1.40, NIH) to
quantify
for
percentage
of
fibrosis
(blue
pixels).
Also
full
circumference bright-field microscope images (6100) of at least
40–50 cross sections of the right and left ventricles along with
infarct region of hearts at day 28 post-AMI were analyzed using
Image-J to quantify infarct size as described [19].
Initial Infarct Size.
To evaluate and compare the initial
infarct size in sham-irradiated, proton and 56Fe ion-irradiated
mice we collected heart samples 3 days post-AMI for 1, 3 and 10
month time points. Heart samples were processed as described
earlier and 6–8 mm section of OCT embedded heart tissue were
double immunostained with primary cTnI antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology Inc. Santa Cruz, CA) followed with Alexa-555 goat
anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Life Technologies) and Topro3.
Confocal images of stained tissue were taken at 6100 magnifica-
tion and analyzed using Image-J software.

Western Blot Analysis
To evaluate the various signaling pathways that regulate cardiac
functions post-IR and post-AMI at 1, 3 and 10 month time points
we performed Western blot analysis at different time points. LV
tissue (n = 3–5/treatment group) at different times after IR (1, 3
and 10 months) and post-AMI (3, 7, 14 and 28 days) were snap-
frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after collection. LV tissue
was homogenized using tissue homogenizer in a buffer containing
20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM
EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate,
20 mM
b-glycerophosphate,
10 mM
Na3VO4,
1 mM
NaF,
1 mM PMSF, and protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche
Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). Samples containing 50 mg of total
protein from the LV tissue lysates were mixed with equal volume
of 62 sample buffer and boiled for 5 min at 95uC. Protein
fractions were then separated by electrophoresis on a 8%, 10% or
15% polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad, Waltham, MA) and blotted
onto PVDF membrane. Detection of total (T) and phosphorylated
(p) protein levels of Akt, Erk1/2, cTnI, p38 and S6k were
performed using antibodies against phospho-specific or total-
specific antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology Inc.).
For NCX and SERCA2a proteins we used monoclonal
antibodies
(Thermo
Scientific,
Tewksbury,
MA)
at
1:1000
dilutions along with HRP-linked horse anti-mouse IgG secondary
antibody at 1:1000 dilution (Cell Signaling Technology Inc.).
Detection of total (T) and phosphorylated (p) protein levels of
NFATc4 was performed using rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) and HRP-linked goat anti-rabbit
secondary. GAPDH (1:40,000 dilution, Millipore, Billerica, MA)
expression was used to adjust the protein loading. Protein levels
were revealed using enhanced chemiluminescence western blotting
method (ECL, Fisher Scientific). Densitometry analysis of the
western blot band brightness was used to obtain total and
phosphorylated levels of a protein. Image J software was used to
measure the band intensities for each respective sequence of
phosphorylated and total protein, and corresponding loading
control.
Statistical Analysis
Results in all graphs are expressed as mean 6 SEM. Statistical
analyses were performed by using one-way ANOVA (Stat View
Software, SAS Institute Inc., Middleton, MA). Differences were
considered significant at P,0.05.
Results
DNA Damage Responses after 1H- and 56Fe-IR in the
Heart Tissue
Kinetics of IR-induced p-H2AX foci.
We studied the
kinetics of p-H2AX foci, a well-characterized marker of DNA
double strand breaks (DSB) [20], by measuring foci levels in
cardiac tissues over the course of 28 days post-irradiation.
Following either 50 cGy of 1 GeV protons or 15 cGy of 1
GeV/n 56Fe ions, IR-induced mean p-H2AX foci levels (corrected
for spontaneous background levels) were higher in non-endothelial
cells (non-EC; represented primarily by cardiomyocytes) versus
endothelial cells (EC) in the heart tissue. Compared to non-IR
control heart tissue (1.5–1.75 p-H2AX foci/cell), ,2–5-fold
increases in p-H2AX foci levels were observed 2–24 hours post-
IR in both EC and non-EC cells and remained significantly
increased above background levels for 7 days (Fig. 1B and Fig.
S1A–B). Further, the disappearance of 56Fe ion-induced p-H2AX
foci was significantly slow, with residual p-H2AX foci observed 28
days post-IR in non-EC cells.
Inflammatory Infiltration.
We found that proton or 56Fe
ion-induced inflammatory responses showed cyclical response
patterns up to 3 months post-IR (Fig. 1C and Fig. S2A–B).
Persistent inflammatory responses may lead to release of various
cytokines, superoxide, nitric oxide and other signaling molecules
by immune cells (i.e., macrophages), which are capable of causing
oxidative tissue damage [21].
Oxidative DNA damage – 8-Oxo-de-oxy-Guanosine (8-oxo-
dG) ELISA.
We measured the level of oxidative DNA damage
by 8-Oxo-de-oxy-Guanosine (8-oxo-dG) ELISA. In proton-irradi-
ated cardiac tissues, increased levels of 8-oxo-dG were detected at
2 and 24 hours post-IR. In 56Fe ion-irradiated cardiac tissues,
significant increases were not observed until 24 hours with the
maximum 8-oxo-dG levels detected at 2 weeks (Fig. 1D),
suggesting
that
56Fe
ion
irradiation
induced
longer-lasting
oxidative damage responses in the heart.
Longitudinal Studies, Radiation and Aging Model
The survival among control, proton-irradiated and 56Fe ion-
irradiated mice up to 10 months was 95–98% (n = 100 animals/
treatment group), and no statistical differences were observed
between control and either IR groups up to 10 months. IR-
induced
alterations
in
cardiac
functions
were
assessed
by
echocardiography (ECHO) and hemodynamic (HEMO) measure-
ments; activation of signaling pathways was assessed by Western
blot analyses.
Cardiac
Physiology
and
Fibrosis.
Hemodynamic
and
echocardiography studies showed that in proton-irradiated hearts,
left ventricular (LV) posterior wall thickness (PWth) was increased
at 1 month (Fig. 2C), which was associated with lower LV end-
diastolic pressure (LVEDP) (Fig. 2E), as well as increased ejection
fraction % (EF%) (Fig. 2B) and dP/dtmin compared to controls
(Fig. 2F), indicating the development of cardiac hypertrophy. LV
PWth was decreased during 3–10 months after proton irradiation
(Fig. 2C), which was associated with the decrease of LV dP/dtmax
and dP/dtmin (Fig. 2F) and increase of cardiac fibrosis compared
to the hearts at 1 month (Fig. 2G and Fig. S3D–I). In control
mice, LV PWth gradually increased with comparable dP/dtmax
and dP/dtmin (Fig. 2C and 2F), whereas cardiac fibrosis
remained unaffected during at least the first 3 months (Fig. 2G).
These results suggest that proton-irradiated hearts may transit
from cardiac hypertrophy to failure 3–10 months post-IR. We also
observed that LVEDP was increased 1 and 3 months after 56Fe ion
irradiation (Fig. 2E). In addition, dP/dtmax and dP/dtmin were
decreased at 1 month (Fig. 2F), suggesting that 56Fe ion-irradiated
hearts developed systolic and diastolic dysfunction as early as 1
month post-IR. This, however, was not associated with increased
cardiac fibrosis at 1 and 3 months (Fig. 2G). In
56Fe ion-
irradiated hearts cardiac function returned to control levels at 10
months (Fig. 2E and 2F).
Candidate Pathways/Molecular Mechanisms.
To deter-
mine underlying molecular mechanisms that may be responsible
for the changes in cardiac function during 10 months post-IR, we
evaluated the expression and the activity of proteins that are
involved in the regulation of Ca2+ handling, p38 MAPK activity,
cardiomyocyte (CM) contractility and hypertrophy in control,
proton and 56Fe ion-irradiated cardiac tissues. At 1 month post-
IR, sodium calcium exchanger (NCX) and Sarcoplasmic Reticu-
lum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA2a), proteins critical for proper calcium
handling
[22],
were
significantly
up-regulated
(Fig. 3A–D)
followed by a decrease of both proteins at 3 months after proton
or 56Fe ion irradiation indicating that exposure to both types of
charged particles altered proper cardiac calcium homeostasis
(Fig. 3I–L). SERCA2a levels returned to un-irradiated control

whereas NCX levels were again increased after
56Fe ion
irradiation (Fig. 3Q–T).
Phosphorylated NFATc4 (Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells,
cytoplasmic, calcineurin-dependent 4) was used to assess activation
and onset of cardiac hypertrophy. Compared to control hearts, we
observed a decrease of NFATc4 phosphorylation in both proton

respectively).
Decreased
phosphorylation of NFATc4 indicates increased activity, suggest-
ing activation of cardiac hypertrophy signaling in both proton and
56Fe ion-irradiated hearts over 10 months. Decreased phosphor-
ylation of NFATc4 was associated with a decrease of p38 MAPK
phosphorylation, a kinase that regulates NFATc4 phosphorylation
[23], in both proton and 56Fe ion-irradiated hearts 1, 3 and 10
months post-IR (Fig. 3G, H, O, P and W, respectively).
Longitudinal Studies, Radiation and Aging in the Setting
of Ischemia - AMI
Left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery ligation was
performed 1, 3 and 10 months after proton and iron irradiation.
For all groups combined, AMI surgery mortality that occurred
within 1–2 days post-LAD ligation was 1461.5%, 1166% and
1063.2% at 1, 3 and 10 months post IR, respectively (N = 24–32
mice/treatment group). Post-AMI survival after LAD ligation was
not significantly different among non-IR control, proton, and 56Fe
ion-irradiated groups up to 28 days post-AMI (100%, 100% and
88613% survived AMI surgery, respectively, p = ns). To assure
that initial infarct size was similar for all IR groups, we evaluated
three mice per treatment group. Three days post-AMI, hearts
were isolated, fixed and stained for cardiac troponin I (cTnI), and
showed no differences among non-IR+AMI, 1H-IR+AMI and
56Fe-IR+AMI groups (Fig. S4A–B).
Cardiac Physiology.
We observed that proton-irradiated
mice had improved cardiac function compared to control mice
when AMI was induced 3 and 10 months post-IR (Fig. 4D–J, L–
M). Compared to non-IR+AMI mice, 1H-IR+AMI mice had
higher dP/dtmax and dP/dtmin and smaller infarct size (Fig. 4J, L,
M and Figs. S5B–C, S7A–B and S8A–B). In addition, 3 and 10
month post-IR and 28 days after AMI, EF% and PWth in 1H-IR+
AMI hearts were comparable to those before AMI (Fig. 4D–E

and F–G). It is conceivable that low-dose proton irradiation may
have some type of preconditioning effect that is reminiscent of
ischemic pre-conditioning in the heart [24].
The results with the AMI model further highlight the inability of
the heart to recover after 15 cGy, 1 GeV/n 56Fe ions, especially
when AMI was induced later at 3 and 10 months post-IR
(Fig. 4D–J and L–M). When AMI was induced 3 months after
IR, LVEDP was significantly increased, and the infarct size was
larger in 56Fe-IR+AMI hearts (Fig. 4I, L and Figs. S5B, S7C).
When AMI was induced 10 months after IR, dP/dtmax and dP/
dtmin were lower (Fig. 4J), the LV wall was thicker (Fig. 4G) and
infarct size was larger in 56Fe-IR+AMI hearts 28 days after AMI
(Fig. 4M, and Figs. S5C, S8C). Compared to control, both 1H-
and 56Fe-IR improved cardiac remodeling at 1 month (post-AMI
scar formation) (Fig. 4K and Figs. S5A, S6A–C).
Candidate Pathways/Molecular Mechanisms.
To deter-
mine the underlying molecular mechanisms associated with long-
lasting effects of proton or 56Fe ion irradiation on post-ischemic
recovery, we analyzed key signaling molecules that regulate
angiogenesis, survival and proliferation, including VEGF-A, Akt,
Erk1/2 and p38 [25–27]. We observed that in 1H-IR+AMI hearts,
the level of VEGF-A and the phosphorylation of Akt, Erk1/2 and
p38 were maintained or less depressed compared to non-IR+AMI
hearts. The phosphorylation of Erk1/2 was even higher in 1H-IR+
AMI vs. non-IR+AMI hearts (Fig. 5C–D). In contrast, phos-
phorylation of these signaling molecules were significantly reduced
in 56Fe-IR+AMI hearts 3 days after AMI (3 months post-IR)
(Fig. 5A–J). Decreases of angiogenic and pro-survival signaling
molecules (Fig. 5A–J) may partially be responsible for the
worsened cardiac function observed in 56Fe-IR+AMI hearts [28].
However, 3 days after AMI in 10 months post-IR hearts, we
observed increased levels of VEGF-A, Erk1/2 and Akt in 56Fe-IR+
AMI hearts compared to 1H-IR+AMI hearts (Fig. 6A–H). No
difference was observed in p38 MAPK activation among all
treatment groups post-AMI at 10 months (Fig. 6I–J). These
increased levels which were comparable to non-IR+AMI hearts,
may indicate a potential need for increased angiogenesis, survival
and growth signaling in
56Fe-IR+AMI hearts that suggest a
greater demand for cell survival signaling perhaps due to more
severe ischemia-induced cardiac damage in 56Fe ion-irradiated
hearts.

Discussion
DNA damage responses following a single low-dose (#0.1 to
0.5 Gy) proton or 56Fe ion irradiation in whole body-irradiated
mouse cardiac tissues have not been evaluated before. Our study
revealed that over 28 days proton or 56Fe ion-induced p-H2AX
foci, a well-characterized marker for the formation and disap-
pearance of DNA DSBs [20], were higher in non-endothelial cells
(non-EC), represented primarily by cardiomyocytes (CM), versus
heart endothelial cells (EC). Further, the decay of proton or 56Fe
ion-induced p-H2AX foci in cardiac tissue was significantly slow
with residual p-H2AX foci observed 28 days post-IR in non-ECs.
We found that proton or 56Fe ion-induced inflammatory responses
have cyclical patterns up to 3 months post-IR, with 56Fe ion
irradiation inducing longer-lasting oxidative damage responses.
This may provide a potential feedback mechanism perpetuating
inflammatory responses in the heart that may lead to significant
alterations in CV physiology and negatively affect systolic and/or

diastolic functions of the heart, induce cardiac hypertrophy, and
increase overall risk for CV disease development.
Radiation and Aging
In our studies, proton irradiation did not negatively impact
heart function 3 months post-IR, but showed negative effects 10
months post–IR. This was manifested by decreased LV systolic
pressure and decreased dP/dtmin, suggesting alterations in both
contractile and relaxation functions in proton-irradiated hearts 10
months after initial exposure. There was also a considerable
increased in cardiac fibrosis in proton-irradiated hearts at 10
months. In terms of molecular signaling there was an activation of
NFATc4 in proton-irradiated hearts that may indicate activation
of cardiac hypertrophy signaling. However, following 56Fe ion
irradiation, significant negative effects on cardiac homeostasis and
function in the heart were observed 3 months post-IR, but not at
10 months. In spite of increased cardiac fibrosis in 56Fe ion-
irradiated hearts at 10 months, cardiac physiology functions were
maintained and rather mildly improved at 10 months post-IR.
We evaluated key molecular pathways in post-IR hearts.
Sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX) plays an essential role in
Ca2+ handling by regulating Ca2+ transport [22]. A large body of
evidence suggest that up-regulation of NCX is a common feature
of HF [29,30], however, increased NCX protein levels by itself do
not corroborate conclusively with HF, as both beneficial and
deleterious effects of NCX in heart failure have been proposed
[29,31]. At the same time, reduced expression and activity of
SERCA2a has been also associated with HF and alterations in
diastolic function [29,31]. Our findings of increased NCX and
SERCA2a levels at 1 month post-IR followed by a decrease at 3
months and unchanged expression in proton and increased
expression in 56Fe ions by 10 months post-IR indicate that both
charged particle types resulted in dysregulation of these important
signaling proteins over 10 months.
One of the major mechanisms of cardiac compensation is
hypertrophy of the heart and the transcription factor, NFATc4, is
one of the well-studied regulators of cardiac hypertrophy [32,33].
NFATc4 under basal unstimulated condition remains highly
phosphorylated and inactive [23] and de-phosphorylation of
NFATc4 results in its activation, which is associated with adult
cardiac hypertrophy [33]. MAP kinases, such as p38 MAPK, have
been shown to regulate NFATc4 phosphorylation and nuclear
translocation [23]. This activation of p38 affects de-phosphorylat-
ed NFATc4 by re-phosphorylation that antagonizes the Ca2+-
mediated
de-phosphorylation
and
nuclear
translocation
of
NFATc4, which results in NFATc4 being exported out of the
nucleus and termination of NFATc4-mediated transcription
[23,32,34], hence cardiac hypertrophy signaling. Meanwhile

activation of the p38 MAPK pathway through phosphorylation of
p38 also results in protection against heart failure by aiding in
cardiac restoration [35]. Decreased activation of p38 MAPK
signaling in 56Fe ion-irradiated hearts at 1, 3 and 10 months could
further negate a possible cardiac protective mechanism(s). There
was activation of NFATc4 in 56Fe ion-irradiated hearts that may
indicate activation of cardiac hypertrophy signaling.
Taken together, our findings in radiation and aging model
demonstrated that at the dose of 50 cGy protons induced initial
cardiac hypertrophy followed by gradual deterioration of cardiac
function over the course of 10 months post-IR. An approximately
equitoxic dose (assuming an RBE of ,3) of 15 cGy of 1 GeV/n
56Fe ions induced an early (1 and 3 months) onset of cardiac
dysfunction. The early and considerable
56Fe ion-mediated
negative CV developments may be indicative of increased risk of
cardiac de-compensation, and may also be predictive of an
increased risk of impaired responses to an ischemic event.
Radiation, Aging and AMI
We evaluated the effect of low dose proton and
56Fe ion
irradiation on the recovery of the heart in a well-accepted ischemic
model of induced AMI (via ligation of left anterior descending
carotid artery). At 50 cGy, 1 GeV a single dose of 1H-IR may have
positive effects for post-ischemic recovery processes in AMI model,
at any time point examined up to 10 months. These include
significantly improved recovery of cardiac contractile and relax-
ation functions and enhanced cardiac remodeling. A number of
molecular pathways that regulate cardiac contractility, survival,
proliferation and angiogenesis may be responsible for these
positive effects in 1H-IR hearts, over the period of 10 months.
At 15 cGy, 1 GeV/n, a single dose of 56Fe-IR presents long-lasting
negative effects for post-ischemic recovery and regeneration
processes in AMI model, at any time point examined up 10
months. These include significant decreases in cardiac contractile
and relaxation function, LV posterior wall hypertrophy and the
worst cardiac remodeling. A number of molecular pathways that
regulate cardiac contractility, survival, proliferation and angio-
genesis may be responsible for these negative effects in 56Fe-IR
hearts, over the period of 10 months.
To determine possible underlying mechanism involved in the
long-lasting negative effects of 56Fe-IR and positive effects of 1H-
IR on post-ischemic recovery we analyzed several molecules in the
key signaling pathways of angiogenesis, survival, proliferation and
apoptosis. The proper regulation of the expression and the activity
of VEGF-A, Akt, Erk1/2 and MAPK p38 aids in recovery and
repair after AMI and, ultimately, in the cardiac remodeling with
the smallest possible scar tissue formation [36]. VEGF-A plays a
critical role in the recovery of cardiac tissue following AMI to
significantly improve heart function through greater cell prolifer-
ation and increased vascular densities in hearts when VEGF-A is

present, helping cardiac tissue to restore normal functions after
ischemic injury [25]. The significantly reduced VEGF-A levels in
56Fe-IR hearts by 3 days post-AMI (3 month post-IR) indicate
decreased angiogenic signaling due to 56Fe-IR, when compared to
non-IR+AMI and to lesser degree to 1H-IR+AMI hearts.
Two well-characterized signaling protein kinases, Erk1/2 and
Akt, are expressed in the heart following AMI to improve and
restore heart function [37]. Erk1/2 is an important regulator of
inflammation and apoptosis [37], which is essential for normal
healing process and removal of damage. Akt also has a role in the
survival signaling and reduction of inflammation that occurs
following AMI [26]. Reduced expression of either or both of these
proteins in combination, as seen in 56Fe-IR+AMI hearts by 3 days
(3 month post-IR) can have deleterious effects on post-AMI
recovery since both are required for removal of ischemia induced
damage and cell survival. In addition to Erk1/2, another member
of mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade p38 MAPK, was
significantly decreased in 56Fe-IR+AMI compared to control+
AMI and
1H-IR+AMI hearts. In cardiac cells p38 MAPK
functions as a stress response and a survival gene and activation
of p38 signaling has been reported to prevent post-AMI heart
failure through up-regulation of angiogenesis and activation of
anti-apoptotic mechanisms [27]. The undetectable levels of
phosphorylated p38 (p-p38) in 56Fe-IR+AMI hearts 3 months
post-IR and 3 days after AMI underscore further impairment of
cardiac protection signaling and suggest an imminent development
of HF in 56Fe-IR hearts [28].
Since it is immeasurably important to determine possible factors
that may increase CV degenerative risks due to low dose ionizing
particle radiation that will allow for development of mitigating
factors to reduce excess CV risks and to maintain cardiac
homeostasis after IR exposure we would like to summarize our
findings as follows: (1) whether it is 56Fe- or 1H-IR, the heart
shows stress and signs of attempted restoration to normal cardiac
functioning; (2) single low dose full body 56Fe and 1H-IR induced
effects on myocardium are of long duration; (3) the significant
negative effects on systolic and diastolic heart functions post-IR, is
largely associated with decreased Ca2+ handling, increased
hypertrophy signaling, decreased cardiac contractile signaling
and decreased p38 MAPK signaling; (4) it is likely that significant
alterations in Ca2+ (NCX, SERCA2a) and cardiac hypertrophy
signaling (NFATc4, p38 MAPK) detected in our longitudinal
studies are early responses to cardiac stress [38], that may arise
from the excessive demand on the heart due to prolonged
activation of compensatory mechanisms; this could lead to changes
in gene transcription and metabolism, thus representing part of the
vicious circle that may precipitate HF; (5) in the ischemic model of
recovery after AMI, multiple signaling pathways that regulate
angiogenesis, survival, proliferation and protein synthesis are
significantly inhibited in 56Fe-IR and activated in 1H-IR hearts 3
months post-IR and 3 days post-AMI, while by in 10 months post-
IR and 3 days post-AMI the expression of these genes were
increased.
Taken together, our data suggest that low dose exposures of
charged particles present in the space radiation environment may
have significant impact on the CV system. These results are the
first reports of the effects of single, low-dose, whole-body proton
and 56Fe ion irradiation on the CV system during normal aging
and under ischemic conditions. We believe that these findings will
provide useful information for risk analysis efforts for future NASA
exploration-type space missions and aid in the development of
mitigating countermeasures to reduce CV risks during long-
duration deep-space missions. In addition, by 2012, more than
120,000 cancer patients in 16 counties [15] have been treated
using particle radiation therapy (RT), primarily protons but also
including carbon and other HZE ions, with similar centers being
planned and constructed every year. Our studies may also provide
a foundation for the development of therapeutic measures to
prevent CV morbidity and mortality due to cancer radiotherapy
(conventional and/or the particle), as well as accidental and
occupational IR exposures.
