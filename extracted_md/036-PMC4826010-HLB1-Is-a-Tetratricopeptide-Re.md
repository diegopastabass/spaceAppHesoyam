Abstract
Background: Actin is essential for tip growth in plants. However, imaging actin in live plant cells has heretofore presented
challenges. In previous studies, fluorescent probes derived from actin-binding proteins often alter growth, cause actin
bundling and fail to resolve actin microfilaments.
Methodology/Principal Findings: In this report we use Lifeact-mEGFP, an actin probe that does not affect the dynamics of
actin, to visualize actin in the moss Physcomitrella patens and pollen tubes from Lilium formosanum and Nicotiana tobaccum.
Lifeact-mEGFP robustly labels actin microfilaments, particularly in the apex, in both moss protonemata and pollen tubes.
Lifeact-mEGFP also labels filamentous actin structures in other moss cell types, including cells of the gametophore.
Conclusions/Significance: Lifeact-mEGFP, when expressed at optimal levels does not alter moss protonemal or pollen tube
growth. We suggest that Lifeact-mEGFP represents an exciting new versatile probe for further studies of actin’s role in tip
growing plant cells.

Introduction
Plants use tip growth to achieve many essential objectives. For
instance, in the moss Physcomitrella patens, plant expansion is initially
carried out by tip growing protonemata and is thus essential for
establishment of the plant [1]. In angiosperms, the pollen grain
germinates on the stigma, and then extends a long tip growing
tube to deliver the sperm to the ovule. Though the relative
importance of various physiological parameters and molecular
regulatory pathways involved in tip growth remains controversial,
the critical role of actin dynamics in promoting this growth is not.
Studies of actin’s role in polarized growth of plant cells have
revealed that the dynamic pool of filamentous actin is tightly
regulated.
Indeed,
nanomolar
concentrations
of
the
actin
depolymerizing drug Latrunculin B disrupt growth without
altering cytoplasmic streaming in pollen [2]. In moss as well,
Latrunculin B inhibits tip growth [3,4]. Investigations of the role
played by different actin binding proteins in moss, root hairs and
pollen tubes have shown that alterations in expression level and
regulation dramatically alter tip growth [2–13]. These data suggest
that the plant cell must maintain a delicate balance between G-
and F-actin to promote tip growth. While the actin cytoskeleton’s
role in polarized growth has been amply demonstrated, it still
remains uncertain at a mechanistic level how actin works to
promote tip growth. A robust tool for live cell imaging would
reveal the structure of the actin network during tip growth and
enable detailed studies of the role of actin in tip growth.
Despite many attempts at characterizing actin in live and fixed
tip growing plant cells, a consensus has not emerged concerning
many features, particularly in the apex. In moss, fixed protone-
mata show a tip localized collar or aggregation of filaments along
with a cortical mesh-work of actin and a network around
chloroplasts [11,13–15]. In pollen tubes, the structures yielded
by fixation have varied substantially; some studies revealed a dense
apical meshwork [16], whereas in others the apical domain was
free of actin [2,17–20]. Other work has pointed to a collar around
the apical region, but this was not initially seen as a consistent
feature [21]. Recently an optimized procedure has revealed the
presence of a consistent apical cortical ‘‘fringe’’ in both rapid-
freeze and room temperature fixed pollen tubes [22].
Though imaging actin in fixed cells provides a great deal of
information, it ultimately yields a static image and is not as useful
as live cell imaging. Imaging live-cells allows for the visualization
of cytoskeletal structures as they change in response to growth
conditions.
This,
though,
has
remained
difficult.
Injecting
rhodamine phalloidin into pollen tubes failed to label actin in
the extreme apex [23]; subsequent work has shown that the probe
is rapidly sequestered into the vacuole. Attempts to express GFP
labeled actin have failed largely because pollen tube growth is
inhibited [21].
Several different actin binding proteins have been used in an
attempt to image actin in growing pollen tubes [24,25]. Actin
depolymerizing factor (ADF) from both lily and tobacco fused to
GFP labels actin and does not dramatically alter cell growth in lily

or tobacco [5,24,25]. However, this probe does not clearly label
the apical domain. Mouse Talin (mTalin) [21,26–28], the second
actin binding domain of fimbrin [24], and recently a pollen
specific LIM protein have also been used to probe actin in live
pollen [25]. These probes have shown utility in other cell types,
but in pollen the images are inconsistent and do not detect all of
the structures shown in the rapidly frozen fixed cells. Specifically,
instead of lily pollen’s cortical actin fringe, the probes reveal a
dense mesh throughout the cell’s tip [5,24,25].
In moss, attempts to use the actin binding domain of fimbrin
fused to GFP have resulted in growth abnormalities and
cytoskeletal
anomalies
(L.

observations).
Although stable expression of mTalin-GFP inhibits cell growth
in moss, recent work using a heat inducible promoter upstream of
mTalin-GFP did produce labeling of actin. However, the transient
nature of the heat-induction only allows for brief imaging of the
actin cytoskeleton [4,29]. In addition, GFP-mTalin has been
shown to inhibit tip growth in root hairs [30].
Here we employ Lifeact, a probe first used in animal cells [31],
to examine actin in live moss protonemata and pollen tubes. This
probe consists of the first 17 amino acids from the budding yeast
ABP-140 fused to GFP. In animal cells Lifeact-mEGFP and
Lifeact fused to FITC effectively label actin without impairing cell
viability [31]. Lifeact peptide fused to FITC has subsequently been
used in mouse oocytes to elucidate a novel actin-based mechanism
for chromosomal motility [32].
Lifeact-mEGFP allows visualization of actin dynamics in
growing moss protonemata and both lily and tobacco pollen
tubes. In moss, the probe labels a distinct and consistent apical F-
actin network at the growing tip of protonemata with a focal point
of F-actin. In lily and tobacco pollen tubes, a highly dynamic
apical F-actin network is labeled defining the clear zone. In all
three organisms a cortical actin network extends rearward through
the cell. In pollen tubes there are also dynamic and distinct interior
filaments that appear to be involved in reverse fountain streaming.
As a live-cell probe, Lifeact provides a new valuable tool for
examining actin organization in tip growing plant cells.
Results and Discussion
Lifeact-mEGFP labels a clear three dimensional apical F-
actin network in moss and pollen
We analyzed Lifeact-mEGFP labeling of actin in protonemata
of the moss Physcomitrella patens, a model bryophyte, and pollen
tubes from Lilium formosanum and Nicotiana tobaccum, representing
monocots and dicots respectively. These well characterized cells
are notable because of their actin dependent, highly polarized tip
growth and the ease with which they are transformed.
We constructed a fusion protein consisting of Lifeact [31] fused
to mEGFP with a seven amino acid linker (Lifeact-mEGFP). We
stably transformed moss with Lifeact-mEGFP under the control of
the maize ubiquitin promoter [33]. Several individually trans-
formed lines of moss were isolated and characterized. For lily and
tobacco pollen, we performed transient transformations with the
same fusion construct under the control of the zmC13 and Lat52
promoters, respectively [34,35]. To visualize the actin cytoskeleton
throughout the cell volume, we used Laser Scanning Confocal
Microscopy (LSCM) and recorded z-stacks of live cells expressing
Lifeact-mEGFP.
Moss protonemata are composed of two cell types: chloronemal
and caulonemal cells. Chloronemata contain many chloroplasts,
have perpendicular cell plates, and have a poorly defined clear
zone. In contrast, caulonemata have fewer chloroplasts, oblique
cell plates, a defined clear zone, and grow about three times faster
than chloronemata. In previous studies, fixed caulonemal cells
have shown an apical actin fringe, but previous live cell imaging,
performed with a heat-shock inducible mTalin-GFP construct, did
not corroborate these findings [4,29]. Here, Physcomitrella proto-
nemata expressing Lifeact-mEGFP were imaged by collecting
serial optical slices in the z axis. In caulonemal cells expressing
Lifeact-mEGFP, an apical F-actin network can consistently be
visualized near the tip of the growing cell and an actin focal point
is also observed (Figure 1A). The brackets define the area rotated
and shown in the inset. This highlights the cortical F-actin network
consistently seen in caulonemal cells. In chloronemal cells a large
amount of F-actin accumulates at the apex, but instead of a small
focal point, it appears as a patch (Figure 1B). Filamentous
structures are visible within the patch and seem to extend out from
it. Towards the back of the cell, the actin microfilaments extend
along the cortex. The inset shows the bracketed region of the cell
rotated 90u. It demonstrates that although longitudinal fibers exist
along the cortex, they are mostly absent from the center of the cell.
Collecting z-stacks of live lily pollen proved challenging as the
cells grow rapidly enough that the stack blurs unless collected faster
than the cell can grow. To partially alleviate this problem, we took
rapid, small images of half the cell’s diameter. In lily pollen tubes, a
clear fringe, consisting of a palisade of short longitudinally oriented
fibers, encircles the cell’s apex (Figure 1C). Forward of this fringe,
few filaments are evident. The inset shows the same image rotated
90u along the y axis, clearly demonstrating that the Lifeact-mEGFP
signal is largely cortical, with reduced signal in the middle of the
tube. Significantly, Lifeact-mEGFP labels both G- and F-actin, so
some of the signal in the center of the tube may be G-actin [31].
However, we routinely observed some microfilaments (F-actin) in
the center of the tube. These images are consistent with the data
from rapidly frozen fixed cells [22].
In tobacco pollen, Lifeact-mEGFP labels longitudinal fibers
along the shank of the tube (Figure 1D). An apical F-actin network
is also present though it is closer to the tip and more dense in the
medial planes than the fringe seen in the lily pollen tube. The inset
shows the same image rotated 90u. It highlights the apical F-actin
network. Although some F-actin is located in the center of the
tube, a great deal is positioned in the cortex. Lifeact-mEGFP
confirms the existence of a fringe in lily as shown in the rapidly
frozen cells [22], and shows that a similar structure exists in
tobacco. Taken together, these data demonstrate the existence of
an apical F-actin network in all three cell types.
Lifeact-mEGFP and phalloidin label the same structures
in MBS-EGS fixed moss cells
Our results with Lifeact-mEGFP were not entirely consistent
with recent work using fluorescently conjugated phalloidin to label
actin microfilaments in moss [11,13]. Though the network labeled
by Lifeact-mEGFP is similar in some respects to that seen in the
fixed-cell images, there are some differences. We wished to
investigate whether the difference between these two F-actin
patterns is due to fixation, or whether Lifeact-mEGFP and
fluorescently conjugated phalloidin are labeling distinct structures.
We began by monitoring Lifeact-mEGFP before and after cross-
linking with MBS-EGS (Figure 2A). Clearly some rearrangements
in the Lifeact-mEGFP pattern occur; most importantly, the tip
localized focal point dissipates and in general the filaments seem
thicker as if bundling has occurred.
To verify that Lifeact-mEGFP and phalloidin label the same
structures, we used MBS-EGS to cross-link cells expressing
Lifeact-mEGFP. After cross-linking, we fixed the cells and
processed them for labeling with rhodamine-phallodin. We then
examined the localization of the two probes (Figure 2B).

Significantly, the probes co-localize throughout the cell, both in
cells that have an apical F-actin network and those that lack apical
labeling (compare top and bottom frames in Figure 2B). These
data demonstrate that Lifeact-mEGFP is labeling the same F-actin
as labeled by rhodamine phalloidin in fixed cells. They also suggest
that MBS-EGS fixation alters the localization of the apical F-actin

network at the extreme apex, causing a loss of signal at the tip and
bundling of filaments towards the rear of the cell. In particular,
fixation enhances labeling of the fringe-like structure in the apex of
some caulonemal cells. Lifeact-mEGFP circumvents these arti-
facts, allowing labeling of actin in living cells.
Lifeact-mEGFP reveals actin dynamics during growth
To image the remodeling of actin filaments and the apical F-
actin network in growing cells, we collected time lapse, medial
plane
images
with
LSCM.
Lifeact-mEGFP
labels
dynamic
filamentous structures throughout moss caulonemal cells. Signif-
icantly, in the medial plane a distinct focal point of actin is seen at
the cell apex (Figure 3A). In the full movie from which these stills
are taken (Movie S1), one can see actin filaments radiating out
from this focal point. The still images, shown at 1 minute intervals,
highlight the highly dynamic actin filaments at the cell apex
(Figure 3A). Interestingly, although an apical focal point of actin is
visible in all growing tip cells, its localization varies. Sometimes it is
at the extreme tip, while at other times it is to the side. Images
using mTalin-GFP have also noted apical accumulations of actin,
although with less distinct filamentous structure [4,29].

longitudinal filaments as well as a dense apical F-actin network
in the medial plane (Figure 3B). Images are shown at 10 second
intervals. Notably, the apical F-actin network is not stationary; it
varies in its exact distance from the tip. However, it does maintain
its position relative to the clear zone of the pollen tube. In the
complete movie it is apparent that short filaments are constantly
moving in and out of the center of the apex (see Movie S2).
In culture, the larger lily pollen grows much more rapidly than
either tobacco or moss. Figure 3C shows medial plane images
taken at 6 second intervals from a growing lily pollen tube. The
cortical actin fringe is observed along the sides of the clear zone, as
seen in fixed cells [22]. In addition, there are some microfilaments
in the apical core that are constantly being remodeled and
occasionally swept rearward (see Movie S3). Furthermore a funnel-
like structure appears to taper backwards from the fringe, also
consistent with previous studies [2].
These data demonstrate that Lifeact-mEGFP labels F-actin
structures and enables imaging of the rapid remodeling of the actin
cytoskeleton in a growing tip cell. Lifeact-mEGFP confirms the
presence of a cortical actin fringe in lily in keeping with what has
been shown in rapid-freeze fixed pollen tube cells probed with
anti-actin antibodies [22]. It also shows a dynamic apical F-actin
network and many longitudinal fibers. These observations differ
from those generated through the use of GFP-ntADF1 and
ntLIM2b-GFP [25], which do not clearly resolve apical filamen-
tous structures, in particular the cortical actin fringe in the apex of
lily pollen tubes.
Rapid actin remodeling occurs at the tip region in moss
Our time lapse imaging of Lifeact-mEGFP showed changes in
the actin network’s structure that were surprisingly fast. To
capture these changes, we imaged Lifeact-mEGFP in moss with a

spinning disc confocal instrument. This instrument scans the frame
360 times a second, instead of scanning through the frame once or
twice a second. It thus eliminates some of the blurring caused by
the scan of the conventional confocal instrument. This allows for
dramatic, rapid alterations in actin to be more accurately imaged.
We acquired a time lapse series of cortical slices in a growing cell
(Figure 4). The images show the rapid remodeling of microfila-
ments occurring in the cortex at the cell tip (Movie S4). Arrows
point to possible buckling events seen very close to the apex. These
results are very similar to recent studies from imaging of actin in

Arabidopsis epidermal cells using variable angle epifluorescence
microscopy [36]. Buckling events have been described before in
vitro. Actin immobilized by myosin at one end then elongated by
formin at the other is forced to buckle, generating significant force
[37]. From the Lifeact-mEGFP images it is of course impossible to
infer the proteins involved in the event, nor can we conclude that
these structures are producing the same forces as seen in the in vitro
experiment. However, these images present compelling evidence
that buckling events might be playing a role in polarized tip
growth in moss.
High expression of Lifeact-mEGFP affects moss
protonemal growth
As many live cell actin probes significantly inhibit growth, we
investigated whether Lifeact-mEGFP affects growth in moss
protonemata or pollen tubes [5,24]. In moss we characterized
Lifeact-mEGFP in two distinct genetic backgrounds: WT and
NLS-4. NLS-4, a line important for RNAi based loss-of-function
studies, is a stable transgenic line that expresses a GFP-GUS fusion
with a nuclear localization signal [11,13,38]. We obtained several
independent lines and analyzed the expression and growth in both
backgrounds.
We isolated protein from seven day old protonemata and used
immunoblotting to evaluate the relative amount of Lifeact-
mEGFP expressed in each line. In the WT background, line 22
expresses twice as much Lifeact-mEGFP as line 20 and nearly half
again as much as line 25 (Figure 5A compare lanes 2, 3 and 4). In
the NLS-4 background, line 8 expresses 3 fold more than the
lowest expressing line (Figure 5A compare lanes 8 and 9). To
determine whether the amount of Lifeact-mEGFP expressed
affects plant growth, we examined the growth properties of the
seven Lifeact-mEGFP lines. Young moss plants regenerating from
protoplasts are composed exclusively of protonemal tissue and one
can measure growth by comparing the area of individual plants.
We stained plants with the fluorescent dye calcofluor, and used the
signal to calculate the area of individual plants. Additionally we
used solidity, which is the area divided by the convex hull area as
an indication of overall filamentous outgrowth (see Methods).
Solidity values approaching one indicate that the plants are solid
and lack polarized extensions; lower values indicate the presence
of
filamentous
outgrowths
and
a
higher
degree
of
plant
polarization [11]. Line 8 in the NLS-4 background results in
smaller
plants
indicating
the
slowest
growth
rate
and
a
concomitant increase in solidity (Figure 5B). This line has the
highest level of Lifeact-mEGFP expression. All the other Lifeact-
mEGFP lines have similar areas as compared to wildtype or the
NLS-4 control. Line 8 appears to produce far fewer caulonemal
cells as compared to controls, presumably contributing to the
increase in solidity. High levels of GFP do not exhibit these growth
defects (data not shown). Interestingly, neither line 8 nor line 22,
the two lines expressing the highest levels of Lifeact-mEGFP,
exhibited dramatic actin artifacts (Figure 5C for representative
images). In contrast, many other actin binding protein probes have
been shown to create circles and large bundles when over
expressed [24,25]. The Lifeact-mEGFP labeling looks similar to
lines with lower levels of expression, although with a higher diffuse
cytoplasmic signal (compare to Figure 1). Our data indicate that
Lifeact-mEGFP expression levels that allow effective imaging in
live cells allow normal cell growth characteristics.
Lifeact-mEGFP thus presents several advantages for studying
the actin cytoskeleton in moss. It avoids potential artifacts arising
from fixation, particularly from the cross-linking; it does not
inhibit filamentous or bulk growth; and expression is constant, so
that no manipulations are necessary to allow for imaging.
Significantly,
Lifeact-mEGFP
is
expressed
in
a

line
presenting the opportunity for studying other structures and
organelles concurrently using different probes.

Lifeact-mEGFP and GFP alone have equivalent affects on
pollen tube growth
Previous studies with actin binding probes have shown that the
amount of DNA used to transform pollen affects both expression
level and growth rates [5,24,25]. To determine if high expression
levels of Lifeact-mEGFP correlated with mortality, we compared
growth in pollen transformed with either 3 mg of plasmid encoding
Lifeact-mEGFP or GFP alone under the control of the zmC13
pollen specific promoter. We imaged transformed pollen tubes
after allowing them to grow for three hours. From these data, we
measured the length and the average fluorescence per pixel in
each pollen tube (Figure 6A). Though the highest expressing tubes
tend to be shorter, this is true for both GFP and Lifeact-mEGFP.
This shows that both GFP and Lifeact-mEGFP at high expression
levels reduce growth, suggesting that high levels of Lifeact-mEGFP
are no more toxic than high levels of GFP.
We wished to compare growth of transformed pollen tubes to
untransformed pollen tubes. To this end we transformed pollen with
Lifeact-mEGFP and collected high-resolution images of trans-
formed and untransformed cells. We then tracked the growth of 10
individual cells of both types for comparison (Figure 6B). Once
again, Lifeact-mEGFP transformed cells exhibit a growth rate that
is not significantly different from untransformed pollen tubes.
To address whether Lifeact-mEGFP negatively affects growth,
we transformed pollen with increasing amounts of Lifeact-mEGFP
and GFP plasmid DNA from 0.75 mg to 3.0 mg. To ensure that
the length of pollen tubes did not change over the course of the
experiment, we fixed the pollen tubes in 3.7% formaldehyde for
30 minutes prior to imaging [2]. The pollen tube lengths were
then measured. At all amounts of DNA, GFP and Lifeact-mEGFP
showed very similar distributions of pollen tube length (Figure 6C).
These findings further validate that Lifeact-mEGFP is no more
toxic to the pollen tube than GFP. To investigate whether Lifeact-
mEGFP was altering actin dynamics, we collected high resolution
z-stack images of pollen that exhibited cytoplasmic streaming but
lacked growth. At no time did we observe the dramatic actin
artifacts seen with other GFP labeled actin binding probes
(Figure 6D) [24,25]. The major difference between these pollen
tubes and the pollen that was growing well, is the lack of a cortical
actin fringe. As the length of Lifeact-mEGFP transformed pollen
tubes was equivalent to pollen tubes expressing GFP alone, it
seems unlikely that alteration in actin dynamics caused these
pollen tubes to grow poorly.
These data indicate that Lifeact-mEGFP can be used to reliably
label actin in growing cells. Alterations to growth due to of high
levels of Lifeact-mEGFP appear to be dependent on the species,
with moss more sensitive than lily pollen. Nevertheless, Lifeact-
mEGFP’s robust labeling suggests that it will provide a tool for
visualizing actin while imaging structures, organelles, or ions.
Similarly, it will serve as an excellent tool for studying the changes
in actin structure as growth oscillates and as manipulations to the
cell’s environment alter growth.
Latrunculin B induced actin depolymerization and
disrupted filamentous localization of Lifeact-mEGFP
signal
The depolymerizing drug Latrunculin B has been widely used to
investigate actin’s role in various cell processes. For example,
nanomolar concentrations abolish growth in pollen tubes but do
not alter cytoplasmic streaming [2,39]. Experiments in moss have
also
demonstrated
sensitivity
to
Latrunculin
B,
though
at
micromolar concentrations in multi-day experiments [3,4]. As
Lifeact-mEGFP appears to be labeling actin faithfully, we sought
to investigate whether its localization would be altered by
Latrunculin B treatment. Specifically, we predicted that concen-
trations of Latrunculin B that inhibit growth would dissipate the
apical F-actin network.
As a first step we examined the effect of Latrunculin B on moss
protonemata by comparing the growth of WT plants to the three
Lifeact-mEGFP lines in the WT background. Lifeact-mEGFP and
WT plants were regenerated from single protoplasts. After four
days, the protoplasts were transferred to media containing
increasing concentrations of Latrunculin B. Two days after
incubation in Latrunculin B, whole plants were imaged to
determine plant area and solidity (see Methods). Increasing
concentrations of Latrunculin B inhibits tip growth, which is
represented by an increase in plant solidity. All assayed lines,
including lines 22 and 25, which contain 2- and 1.5-fold more
Lifeact-mEGFP respectively (Figure 5A), had similar IC50 for
Latrunculin B (Figure 7A). This is particularly significant because
it suggests that actin is not stabilized by increasing amounts of the
Lifeact-mEGFP probe, consistent with previous in vitro results [31].
To examine the effects of Latrunculin B on actin localization as
visualized by Lifeact-mEGFP, we transferred Lifeact-mEGFP
expressing plants to agar pads containing DMSO, 0.5 mM or
1.25 mM Latrunculin B. Cells were then imaged after 10 minutes.
Cells in DMSO showed no alteration in either growth or Lifeact-
mEGFP signal (Figure 7B and data not shown). Cells imaged from
the 0.5 mM treatment had stopped growing. They also showed fewer
actin filaments, and manifested punctate fluorescence suggesting F-
actin depolymerization. The cells incubated in 1.25 mM Latrunculin
B also stopped growing and lost any clear actin localization; instead
the fluorescence was diffuse throughout the cytoplasm.
To analyze Latrunculin B treatment on pollen tubes, we
transformed lily pollen with Lifeact-mEGFP and allowed it to
grow for two hours in standard media. After imaging selected cells
for several minutes, we replaced the growth media with media
supplemented with 2 nM Latrunculin B. This concentration has
been used in the past to reversibly terminate growth [2,39]. We
then collected a time lapse image series of the growing pollen tube
as it reacted to the drug. Before treatment, the clear zone is
apparent and the fringe appears as cortical brightness in a medial
plane view (Figure 7C, representative image). Figure 7D shows the
same tube after growth has stopped. In line with previous results,
the clear zone has collapsed and the tip has swollen. Cytoplasmic
streaming continues, but it is no longer organized into the typical
reverse fountain [2] (Movies S5 and S6). The fringe has dissipated.
Some actin filaments remain, but they are disorganized and
largely cortical (Movie S6). Imaging multiple planes in the z-axis
reveals filamentous staining in the cortex, but the microfilaments
appear to be randomly oriented (Figure S1). These data indicate
that the apical F-actin network is important for growth.
Our results indicate that Lifeact-mEGFP expressing moss
protonemata and pollen tubes both respond to Latrunculin B
treatment. In moss, protonemal cells cease growing and filamen-
tous Lifeact-mEGFP fluorescence is lost. In lily pollen tubes,
Lifeact-mEGFP fluorescence is reduced, the tubes stop growing
and the tip swells. The tremendous difference in sensitivity to the
drug likely results from the wide variance in growth rates; pollen
tubes endocytose at a fast pace [40] and therefore will take up a
great deal of the drug quickly, whereas the slowly growing moss
may take it up more slowly.

labeling in a variety of different cell types using line 25. We took

advantage of this to examine branch formation in a chloronemal cell
(Figure 8A). As the branch begins to emerge, a focal point of actin
develops at the tip. Behind this, the actin caging around the
chloroplasts is clearly evident. This focal point increases in size as the
branch lengthens, resembling the apical actin structure observed in
chloronemal cells at the apex of a filament. Finally, a phragmoplast
forms at the cell junction (Figure 8A). We collected z-stacks of
subapical caulonemal cells. Not surprisingly, the cages around
chloroplasts are less prominent as these cells have many fewer
chloroplasts. However longitudinal cortical filaments are evident as is
a striking accumulation of Lifeact-mEGFP at the cell plate. We also
examined cells in gametophore leaflets. Labeling of cortical
microfilaments is apparent as is caging around the chloroplasts.
Taken together these images demonstrate that Lifeact-mEGFP
enables live imaging of actin in a variety of cell types.
Conclusions
In this report we use Lifeact-mEGFP as a live cell probe for
actin in the moss Physcomitrella patens as well as in pollen from two
species, Lilium formasanum and Nicotiana tobaccum. Our data indicate
that
Lifeact-mEGFP possesses significant advantages
in tip
growing cells over other commonly used live-cell probes. At

moderate levels of expression, Lifeact-mEGFP does not inhibit
growth in moss and because of this, there is no need to induce
expression of the probe; it can be expressed from a constitutive
promoter. In moss Lifeact-mEGFP highlights an apical patch of
actin filaments in chloronemal cells and a focal point of F-actin in
caulonemal cells. These apical networks appear to be areas of
intense actin filament production. In pollen tubes, the probe does
not retard tip growth. In lily pollen, Lifeact-mEGFP fluorescence
compellingly supports the presence of a cortical actin fringe as
shown in rapidly frozen and fixed cells [22]. The images are more
consistent and the signal to noise ratio is higher than seen with
other probes in live pollen tubes [24–26]. Tobacco cells also
exhibit a variable apical network as they grow. Interestingly, in
both pollen species the apical F-actin network is seen to define the
edge of the clear zone. The apical F-actin networks in all three
species are constantly changing during growth, manifesting the
role of dynamic actin in growth. Most significantly, Lifeact-
mEGFP will serve as a useful tool for studying the role of actin in
living tip growing cells, thus allowing for a much more complete
analysis of the factors, both physiological and molecular, involved
in tip growth.
Methods
Constructs and Stable Line Construction
pTH-Ubi-Lifeact-mEGFP was constructed via multi-site gateway
(Invitrogen). Entry clones containing the Lifeact peptide and mEGFP
were generated via BP clonase from PCR products. For Lifeact, the
first 51 bp of the coding sequence of the ABP140 gene were amplified
from yeast genomic DNA, using primers: LifeactB1F-GGGGA-
CAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTAATGGGTGTCGCA-
GATTTG, and LifeactB5rR-GGGGACAACTTTTGTATACAA-
AGTTGTTTCTTCCTTTGAGATGCTTTC. For mEGFP, we
used primers: attB2-mEGFP-STOP-r-GGGGACCACTTTGTA-
CAAGAAAGCTGGGTATTACTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATG-
CC and attB5-mEGFP-STOP-f-GGGGACAACTTTGTATACA-
AAAGTTGTGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGAG. The entry clones
generated by the BP clonase reaction were sequenced and cloned
together into pTH-Ubi-Gate [2] via LR clonase. The resulting
expression construct was verified by restriction digest. For stable
transformation, plasmids were digested with SwaI and transformed
using standard procedures [13]. Stable plants were identified by the
resistance to hygromycin, after periods of release from selection.
Lifeact-mEGFP was amplified out of pTH-Ubi-Lifeact-mEGFP
using the sense primer GGGGGATCCATGGGTGTCGCA-
GATTTGAT
and
the
anti-sense
primer
CACGTCGACT-
TACTTGTACAGCTCGTCC. For tobacco pollen expression,
the fragment was then digested with Bam HI and Sal I and
inserted into a modified pBS SKII+ that includes the Lat52
promoter [34]. For lily expression, the same construct was
subcloned into pBS SKII+ under the control of the zmC13
promoter using the same enzymes [35].
Bombardment
Plasmid DNA was prepared using alkaline lysis followed by
precipitation with PEG and extraction with phenol-chloroform.
DNA was coated onto 1 to 3 mg of 1.1 mm diameter tungsten
particles (Bio-Rad Laboratories) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The coated microprojectiles were aliquoted onto two
macrocarriers (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Pollen was allowed to
hydrate in 1 mL of the appropriate growth media (see below)
before being placed on a 25 mm MF-Millipore membrane
(Millipore), which in turn was set on Whatmann paper moistened
with pollen growth media. The macrocarrier assembly was
positioned in the top slot of the PDS-1000/He biolistic system
and the sample assembly in the slot below (Bio-Rad). Pollen grains
were bombarded twice (once with each aliquot) using an 1100-psi
rupture disc (Bio-Rad). After bombardment, pollen was trans-
ferred to a microcentrifuge tube and incubated for 2 hours at
room temperature with constant rotation. Cells were then
immobilized on a microscope slide in growth media supplemented
with 1.4% low-melting point agarose and imaged 1–4 hours later.
Pollen/Moss Culture Conditions
For high-resolution imaging, protonemata were subcultured on
moss NO3 medium, PpNO3 (1.03 mM MgSO4, 1.86 mM KH2PO4,
3.3 mM Ca(NO3)2, 45 mM FeSO4, 9.93 mM H3BO3, 220 nM
CuSO4, 1.966 mM MnCl2, 231 nM CoCl2, 191 nM ZnSO4,
169 nM KI, 103 nM Na2MoO4) for at least three days before
transfer to an imaging chamber. Protonemata were placed on a 1%
agar pad in Hoagland’s medium (4 mM KNO3, 2 mM KH2PO4,
1 mM Ca(NO3)2, 89 mM Fe citrate, 300 mM MgSO4, 9.93 mM
H3BO3, 220 nM CuSO4, 1.966 mM MnCl2, 231 nM CoCl2,
191 nM ZnSO4, 169 nM KI, 103 nM Na2MoO4, 1% sucrose),
covered with a glass coverslip, sealed with VALAP (1:1:1 parts of
vaseline, lanoline and paraffin) and immediately observed. Bleaching
and cell damage were minimized by using low laser levels (1–2%).
All pollen was grown from frozen stocks (280uC) collected from
plants grown under standard greenhouse conditions. Lilium
formosanum pollen was germinated and cultured in growth medium
consisting of 7% (w/v) Sucrose, 1 mM KCl, 1.6 mM H3BO3, and
15 mM MES buffer adjusted to pH 5.5 with KOH (LPGM).
Nicotiana tabacum (cv Petit Havana SR1) pollen was germinated and
cultured in medium consisting of 20 mM MES, 0.07% Ca(NO3)2
tetrahydrate, 0.02% MgSO4, 0.01% H3BO3, 0.01% KNO3 and
7% sucrose adjusted to pH 6. Pollen was germinated and grown
on a rotor at room temperature. For microscopic observations, a
pollen suspension was plated and immobilized with a growth
medium solution containing a final concentration of 0.7% (w/v)
low-melting agarose. The immobilized pollen was then covered
with growth media for imaging.
Microscopy
Images were collected using the 488 nm argon laser of a Nikon
confocal microscope (Nikon D-Eclipse-C1) on an inverted stand
(Nikon Eclipse-TE2000-S) using a 606 oil immersion 1.4-
numerical aperture objective, a 406 oil immersion 1.3-numerical
aperture objective, or a 606 water immersion 1.2-numerical
aperture objective. Spinning disc confocal images were acquired
with a Perkin Elmer confocal box and an OrcaER CCD camera
on a Nikon inverted stand with a 1006 oil immersion 1.4-
numerical aperture objective.
Protein extraction and immunoblotting
Moss protein was extracted from previously frozen tissue that was
immersed in liquid nitrogen prior to extraction. The tissue was first
homogenized in liquid nitrogen, then grinding buffer (100 mM
Na2PO4 pH 7.0, 10 mM DTT, 20% glycerol and 0.1% protease
inhibitor cocktail (P9599 Sigma))was added and the resulting slurry
was further homogenized. The slurry was then subjected to
centrifugation for 10 minutes in a benchtop microfuge. The resulting
extract was separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose
membrane and immunoblotted with anti-sera to GFP (Invitrogen).
Image Processing
Image processing was performed with AutoDeblurGold Cf
(MediaCybernetics) using 5–30 three-dimensional deconvolution

iterations and displayed as a maximal z-projection for z-sections.
For image sequences, two dimensional blind deconvolution was
performed using 5–30 iterations. Subsequent deblurring was
performed with the same software.
Moss Fixation
Ethylene glycol bis[succinimidylsuccinate] (EGS) and m-Mal-
eimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (MBS) treatment were
applied to plants growing in open chambers under the same media
conditions as the closed chambers, but the protonemata were
immobilized with 0.7% low melting point agarose. MBS and EGS
were added to 30 mM and 100 mM respectively from 1006
DMSO stocks. Cells were treated with the crosslinkers for 15 min
before observation. For fixation and phalloidin staining, cells were
processed the same way as previously reported (Vidali et al., 2007)
but using rhodamine phalloidin (Invitrogen) instead of Alexa-488
phalloidin.
Growth Assay
For the moss growth assay, one week old cultures of stable lines
were protoplasted using established methods [11]. Plants were
regenerated in top-agar (0.5% agar) in the presence of manitol for
4 days, then transferred to growth moss NH4 medium, PpNH4
(1.03 mM MgSO4, 1.86 mM KH2PO4, 3.3 mM Ca(NO3)2,
2.7 mM
(NH4)2-tartrate,
45 mM
FeSO4,
9.93 mM
H3BO3,
220 nM CuSO4, 1.966 mM MnCl2, 231 nM CoCl2, 191 nM
ZnSO4, 169 nM KI, 103 nM Na2MoO4) for 2 days and imaged.
Cell walls were stained with a solution of 10 mg/ml calcofluor
(fluorescent brightener 28, Sigma) in water for at least 15 min.
Cellophane fragments with the cells embedded in top agar were
inverted on 10 ml of staining solution, incubated for 1 min, and the
cellophane was removed. An additional 10 ml of staining solution
was added and mounted with a coverslip. The cells were incubated
for at least 15 min and no more than 1 hr. Pictures were taken at
306 zoom with a 16 lens, as 36-bit RGB color images with a
CCD
camera
(Leica
DF300FX) on a
fluorescence
stereo-
microscope (Leica MZ16FA). Filter combinations were for UV/
DAPI setting. The blue channel of the color images, correspond-
ing to cell wall signal was digitally separated. The resulting 12-bit
image was thresholded and the total area estimated. Solidity, a
morphometric parameter, was evaluated by calculating the ratio of
the plant area to its convex hull area; one corresponds to a
perfectly solid object and numbers smaller correspond to more
branched structures. A total of 30 to 60 plants was evaluated for
each replicate. All image analysis was done using macros written
for ImageJ (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). Macros are available
upon request. Statistical analysis was done using ANOVA and
post-hoc tests in KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software).
To compare the average fluorescence per pixel to length in lily,
pollen was bombarded with 3 mg of zmC13::Lifeact-mEGFP or
zmC13::mEGFP. Images were collected using the 488 nm argon
laser of a Nikon confocal microscope (Nikon D-Eclipse-C1) on an
inverted stand (Nikon Eclipse-TE2000-S) and a 106dry objective.
Image analysis was performed using ImageJ (http://rsb.info.nih.
gov/ij/). For the high resolution rate of growth analysis of lily,
pollen was bombarded with 1.8 mg of zmC13::Lifeact-mEGFP
then imaged 3 hours later. Pollen was imaged at 406 using the
Nikon D-Eclipse-C1 microscope. Growth was tracked using
MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices) and the distance from
the origin was then plotted versus time. A linear regression was fit
to the data and the slope represented the average velocity for the
tube. To analyze the length distribution of pollen, the indicated
amount of either zmC13::Lifeact-mEGFP or zmC13::mEGFP
used to bombard pollen. The pollen was allowed to grow for
3 hours then fixed in 10 mM MgCl2, 100 mM PIPES, and 3.7%
formaldehyde for 30 minutes. The pollen was then washed in
LPGM, imaged and measured as described for the florescence vs.
length assay. All statistical analysis was performed using Origin
software (OriginLab, www.orginlab.com).
Drug Treatments
For the analysis of Latrunculin B effects on F-actin, moss was
cultured in PpNO3 media for 3–5 days, on top of cellophane disks.
Pieces of cellophane containing protonemata were cut, flipped,
and the protonemata were placed in direct contact with an agar
pad containing Hoagland’s medium and Latrunculin B at the
indicated concentration. The cellophane was removed, 5 ml of
liquid medium containing the same concentration of Latrunculin
B were added, and a coverslip placed on top. The chamber was
sealed with melted VALAP. Images were acquired with an interval
of 10–20 min after chamber preparation. Control preparations
contained DMSO at 0.2% in medium. Multiple cells and
chambers were analyzed with identical results.
For the Latrunculin B sensitivity assay in moss, cells were
prepared in the same way as for the growth assay (see above).
Protoplasts were plated on small cellophane circles on top of agar
in 96 well plates; wells were filled to the top with agar to create a
flat surface to deposit the protoplasts. Cells were plated in
protoplast regeneration medium in the absence of Latrunculin B
for 4 days. At day 4 the cellophane discs were transferred to
regular PpNH4 medium containing different amounts of Latrun-
culin B. Two days after transfer images were acquired from
chlorophyll autofluorescence at a 306 zoom as 36-bit RGB color
images with a CCD camera (Leica DF300FX) on a fluorescence
stereo-microscope (Leica MZ16FA). Filter combinations were:
excitation 480/40, dichroic 505 long pass, emission 510 long pass.
The red channel of the color images, corresponding to chlorophyll
fluorescence was digitally separated. The resulting 12-bit image
was thresholded and the solidity estimated as mentioned above.
Latrunculin treatments were performed in triplicate; a total of 7 to
38 plants was measured in each replicate. Dose response curves
were fitted to the data using the sigmoidal fitting function of the
program Origin (Microcal), using a logistic equation and a log10
scale for the concentration of Latrunculin B. The half maximal
inhibitory concentration (IC50) was estimated from these fits. To
compare the significance of the differences an ANOVA statistical
test was used between the means obtained for each replicate. To
calculate fractional solidity for each cell line and to plot the data,
the following transformation was used: the minimum values
obtained from the curve fitting were subtracted from the mean
values; the resulting value was divided by the maximum value
obtained by curve fitting.
For lily, bombarded pollen was grown on a slide and imaged
according to our standard procedure (see above). The growth
media was then replaced with fresh media plus 2 nM Latrunculin
using a pipette. The procedure was performed twice to ensure that
all of the media had been replaced.
