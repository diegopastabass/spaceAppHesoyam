Abstract
Plant-specific PIN-formed (PIN) efflux transporters for the plant hormone auxin are required for tissue-specific directional
auxin transport and cellular auxin homeostasis. The Arabidopsis PIN protein family has been shown to play important roles
in developmental processes such as embryogenesis, organogenesis, vascular tissue differentiation, root meristem
patterning and tropic growth. Here we analyzed roles of the less characterised Arabidopsis PIN6 auxin transporter. PIN6 is
auxin-inducible and is expressed during multiple auxin–regulated developmental processes. Loss of pin6 function interfered
with primary root growth and lateral root development. Misexpression of PIN6 affected auxin transport and interfered with
auxin homeostasis in other growth processes such as shoot apical dominance, lateral root primordia development,
adventitious root formation, root hair outgrowth and root waving. These changes in auxin-regulated growth correlated with
a reduction in total auxin transport as well as with an altered activity of DR5-GUS auxin response reporter. Overall, the data
indicate that PIN6 regulates auxin homeostasis during plant development.

Introduction
The plant hormone auxin is involved in embryogenesis,
organogenesis, vascular tissue differentiation, and hypocotyl and
root elongation, as well as growth responses to environmental
stimuli. Auxin is synthesized in the shoot, leaf tips as well as in the
root apex, and transported to other parts of the plant. Auxin
signaling requires the interplay of auxin biosynthesis, conjugation,
transport and perception, and can be modified through complex
interactions with other hormones (see reviews by [1,2,3]). Auxin
moves in a polar manner from cell to cell or through the phloem
from source to sink tissues. The basipetal auxin flow occurs from
the shoot apex to the base and contributes to maintaining apical
dominance. In roots, auxin moves both acropetally through the
central stele and basipetally through the epidermis and outer
cortex near the root tip [4,5]. Polar cell-to-cell auxin transport is
mediated by carrier proteins of the AUX1 (Auxin resistant 1),
LAX (like-AUX1), PGP (Phospho-glycoprotein) and PIN (pin-
formed) families [3]. While AUX1, LAX and certain PGP-type
proteins are involved in auxin import [6,7,8], there are other PGP-
type and PIN proteins that mediate auxin export from the cell
[6,9].
The Arabidopsis genome encodes eight PIN proteins and their
sequences differ mainly in the central hydrophilic region. PIN
proteins 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 contain a large hydrophilic loop, PIN6
contains a partially reduced loop, while PIN5 and PIN8 lack the
central hydrophilic domain [9,10,11]. Accordingly, phylogenetic
analysis in Arabidopsis indicated that the PIN family can be
divided into two subclasses, the plasma membrane (PM) localized
PIN1-type (PIN1, 2, 3, 4, 7) and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
localized PIN5-type (PIN5, 6, 8) [10,12] that appear functionally
distinct. The asymmetric localization of the plasma membrane-
localized PIN proteins determines the direction of inter-cellular
auxin flow [13].
PIN proteins function to coordinate vascular tissue differenti-
ation and regeneration [14,15], meristem maintenance and
patterning in roots [16,17,18] as well as organ development in
general [19,20]. The loss-of-function pin1 mutant shows the most

extensive phenotype as it grows a pin-shaped floral stem
inflorescence devoid of floral organs due to lower auxin transport
[14,21]. Mutations in pin2 (or ethylene insensitive root 1; eir1)
reduced root waving, and the PGP1 and PGP19 phosphoglyco-
protein (PGP) auxin transporters [22,23] as well as the WAG1/
WAG2 PINOID related protein-serine/threonine kinases, which
are critical factors in PIN membrane polarity establishment, also
affect root waving [24,25,26,27]. However, whether there are
particular roles for specific PIN proteins in root waving is not well
documented or understood.
The phenotypes associated with the loss-of-function of PIN1,
and to lesser extent PIN2, 3, 4 and 7 can be phenocopied by some
synthetic
auxin
transport
inhibitors
[9,28,29,30].
The
best
characterized auxin-associated phenotypes are dose-dependent
effects on shoot apical dominance and branching, the emergence
of root hairs, primary root elongation, lateral root initiation and
emergence as well as responses to gravity [31,32,33,34,35]. The
PIN genes have functions linked to organogenesis (PIN1), pattern
formation during embryogenesis (PIN1, PIN4 and PIN7) and
phototropic responses as well as various forms of tropism (PIN2
and PIN3) [16,28,30,36,37]. The ER localised PIN5 and PIN8
proteins mediate auxin exchange between the ER lumen and
cytosol and play an important role in the control of the ER-
resident auxin metabolism [10,38,39]. PIN6 is the last member of
this developmentally important gene family and despite being
recently shown to have a function in the development of
Arabidopsis stamens and nectary production, its function in
mediating auxin growth processes remains functionally unchar-
acterised [40].
Here we show that PIN6 is a crucial component of auxin
transport and auxin homeostasis and contributes to auxin-
dependent growth and development processes such as root and
shoot growth as well as reproductive development.
Materials and Methods
Plant Growth Conditions and Transgene Selection
Seeds were cold-stratified in the dark for 3 days and grown at
21uC under a 16 hour photoperiod (150 mmol quanta m2 s1
irradiance), unless otherwise stated. Sterilised seeds were grown on
Murashige and Skoog (MS) media (4.4 g/L MS salts and vitamins,
1% sucrose, 0.8% agar). Transgenic Arabidopsis (Col-O) lines
harbouring pMDC32::PIN6 or TPIN6::FiLUC were selected on MS
media containing 50 mg/mL hygromycin (Invitrogen) or 50 mg/L
BASTA (Sigma-Aldrich), respectively.
Mutants Used in this Study
All germplasm were in the Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia
(Col-0) background. Germplasm used in this study include TDNA
insertion lines [Salk_046393 (pin6-2), Salk_092831 (pin6-4), GABI-
KAT_430B01 (pin6-5) and GK711C09 (pin6-6)].
Construction of PIN6 Overexpression, Promoter-reporter
Gene as Well as RNA Silencing Constructs and Selection
of Representative Transgenic Lines
A PIN6 overexpression vector was created by PCR amplifying a
PIN6 (AT1G77110) genomic fragment (24bp 59UTR, 3554 bp
gene and+119 bp 39UTR) using high fidelity Platinum Pfx Taq
Polymerase and primers (Table S1) according to the manufactur-
er’s instructions (Invitrogen). The PIN6 genomic product was
cloned into the pMDC32 overexpression vector [41] using
GatewayH Technology to create pMDC-35s::PIN6. A PIN6
promoter sequence (2705 bp) thought to contain most of the
upstream regulatory domain was amplified using DYNAzyme
Polymerase and primers (Table S1), according to instructions
(FINNZYMES). The promoter fragment was cloned into ZERO
BluntH TOPOH (INVITROGEN) intermediate vector creating
TOPO::PIN6. The PIN6 promoter was subsequently cloned into
pTm35::FiLUC (digested with XbaI/NcoI to remove the minimal
CaMV 35S promoter) creating pTPIN6::FiLUC. A promoter-GUS
reporter fusion was created by amplifying a much larger upstream
region (23763 bp; primers listed in Table S1) of the PIN6
promoter fragment and cloning the amplicon into pMDC162 [41]
using GatewayH Technology (Invitrogen) to create pMDC-
PIN6::GUS. pPIN6::GUS, pTm35enh::FiLUC and pTm35::Fi-
LUC were prepared as previously described [20,42].
Binary constructs were transferred into Agrobacterium strain
LBA4404 and transformed into Arabidopsis thaliana (Col-0) using
conventional techniques [43]. Selection criteria for choosing
representative transgenic lines were based upon; 1) a consensus
in the promoter’s tissue specific reporter gene expression pattern,
2) strength of reporter gene activity levels in leaf tissues, and 3) a
consistent 3:1 Mendelian segregation of selectable marker genes.
Representative lines are indicated for pTPIN6::FiLUC (Fig. S1A),
pMDC-PIN6::GUS (Fig. S2B, 2C) and pPIN6::GUS [20].
Root Waving Phenotyping
Surface sterilised seeds were sown onto the surface of agar
plates
(1.5%
agar
supplemented
with
modified
Hoagland
solution, 1% sucrose, 0.5% MES; pH = 5.7) and cold stratified
for 3 days. The plates were then placed vertical in a controlled
growth chamber with setting defined above. The position of the
root tip was marked daily to derive root elongation rates and 10
DAG plates were scanned enabling measurements of root
length, wave length (distance between 2 successive crests) and
wave amplitude (orthogonal distance between wave crest and
root axis) using the ImageJ software. These measurements were
used to calculate root spatial and temporal waving frequencies.
Root length measurements correspond to developed lengths
(determined by following the paths of each root, including along
waves) of at least 12 seedlings per line in three successive
experiments.
Auxin Transport Assays
Pulse chase auxin transport experiments were performed as
described [44]. Four to twelve independent basal inflorescence
stem sections, mean length 30 mm, were cut from 30-day-old
plants. Inverted sections were pulsed for 60 min by immersion in
20 ml 400 nM 3H-IAA (1 mCi.ml-1; Amersham Biosciences, UK),
rinsed with 400 nM unlabelled IAA and chased with 20 ml un-
labelled 400 nM IAA (150 min). Stem sections were cut into
3 mm long sections which were extracted into Ecolite scintillant
overnight and radioactivity in each segment was analyzed by
scintillation counting.
Auxin Root Growth Assays
One component of auxin homeostasis is the conjugation of IAA
to different moieties, including linkage to amino acids like IAA-
Alanine (IAA-Ala). This type of auxin is compartmentalized in the
ER and therefore a sensitivity test to IAA-Ala can reveal the extent
to which auxin homeostasis has been perturbed [45]. Seedlings
were transferred 3 days after germination to MS agar containing
media supplemented with IAA (10, 50 and 100 nM) or IAA-
Alanine (10, 20, 30mM) and relative elongation rate was
determined as percentage of the control treatment (EtOH).
Experiments were performed twice with similar results.

Plant Phenotyping
Non-destructive measurements of plant growth were performed
using a plant image capture and analysis system (Scanalyzer 3D,
LemnaTec, Wu¨rselen, Germany; http://www.lemnatec.de/ sca-
nalyzer_gh.htm). For root apical meristem (RAM) size measure-
ments, 7 DAG roots were stained with propidium iodide and
visualised by confocal microscopy. Root meristem size was defined
as the distance from the quiescent centre to the first cells displaying
elongation. For stage distribution of lateral root development, 15–
20 roots from 9-day-old seedlings were processed. Lateral root
primordia density was analyzed as previously described [46].
Experiments were performed twice, with a similar phenotypic
outcome.
Chlorophyll Assays
Chlorophyll
measurements
were
performed
as
previously
described
with
the
following
modifications:
pigments
were
extracted in 80% acetone, and absorbance was measured at
647, 664 and 750nm [47,48,49].
Real Time Quantitative PCR
Total RNA extraction, first strand cDNA synthesis and
quantification of relative transcript levels were performed as
previously described [50]. Cyclophilin (At2g29960) was used to
normalise for biological variation in cDNA loading and primer
sequences are listed in Table S1. Three technical replicates were
performed and the results shown are representative of two
independent experiments.
b-glucuronidase and Luciferase Reporter Gene Assays
b-Glucuronidase and luciferase assays were performed as
previously described [51,52,53].
Results
PIN6 Exhibits Tissue and Organ Specific Expression
Patterns
The tissue specific regulation of the PIN6 promoter (23763 bp,
21794 bp or 2705 bp) was investigated in detail using b-
glucuronidase and firefly luciferase as reporters of gene expression.
A large number of PIN6 promoter-reporter transgenic lines were
generated (Figs. S1 and S2), and detailed analyses are shown for
several lines. In young seedlings, PIN6 reporter expression was
weak in the primary root, hypocotyl, shoot apex as well as
cotyledons (Fig. S1B). Basal levels of PIN6 expression were also
observed in specific tissue types observed from mature plants,
when compared to the constitutive CaMV 35S promoter (Fig.
S1C). The PIN6::reporter lines enabled 20-fold lower leaf reporter
activities when compared to the strong CaMV 35S-reporter lines
(Fig. S1A and S2B). These experimental findings were consistent
with
anatomical
gene
expression
analysis
performed
using
Genevestigator, which confirms that PIN6 is lowly expressed in
most seedling tissues (Fig. S2A). Furthermore, in silico analysis of
published microarray data showed that during development
mRNA expression levels of the ER-targeted subclade of PIN
transporters (PIN5 and PIN8) as well as PIN6, are generally less
abundant than those of the PM targeted PIN transporters PIN1, 2,
7, 3 and 4 (Fig. S2D). Interestingly, the chromatin modification
mark of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27) that is
associated with low levels of gene expression [54], was enriched
surrounding the promoter and/or gene coding regions of the most
weakly expressed PIN genes (PIN8, 5, 6, 1 and 2) (Fig. S2E).
The expression of PIN6 is not only developmentally regulated,
but also specific of particular tissues in a cell-type specific manner
(Fig. 1 and Fig. S2). During germination weak PIN6::GUS staining
was observed in the embryos from fresh seeds and became
considerably stronger in dried seed embryos (Fig. 1A, B). GUS
activity was observed near the shoot meristem, root tip (RAM) and
root vasculature (Fig. 1B to D). In general, there was a noticeable
decline in PIN6 reporter expression during seedling development.
Later during seedling development, PIN6 promoter activity was
very low in the main root meristem and vasculature (Fig. 1P and
Q). PIN6, was however, expressed during lateral root initiation,
becoming restricted to the margins of the developing primordium
later during lateral root development (Fig. 1F to J) as shown
previously [20]. After lateral root emergence, PIN6 promoter
activity was strongest in the outer cell layers of the lateral root
meristem (Fig. 1K). Most, interestingly, the floral stem tissues
showed higher reporter activity levels (Fig. S2B with S2C), which is
consistent with an obvious spike in PIN6 mRNA levels observed in
floral bolts during a PIN developmental expression profile (Fig.
S2D) [55]. Finally, the PIN6 promoter enabled reporter expression
in flowers (Fig. S1D), in particularly the nectaries and the floral
organ boundaries of the anthers (Fig. 1L to N).
We next investigated the effect of auxin on PIN6 promoter
activity. Auxin stimulation (10 mM 2,4-D) induced PIN6::GUS
staining in the shoot apical meristem (Fig. 1T), the root stele
(including pericycle and endodermis) near the hypocotyl (Fig. 1U),
and RAM (Fig. 1V). In lateral root primordia the induction of
PIN6::GUS activity by auxin treatment was less obvious (Fig. 1W
and 1X). This is in line with the presence of auxin response
elements in the PIN6 promoter, including AS1-like (TGACG;
291 bp, 2839 bp), AuxRE (TGTCTC; 21292 bp, 2993 bp)
and NDE (CATATG; 1262 bp) [56,57,58]. In summary, the PIN6
promoter activity is observed specifically in different developmen-
tal processes and can be induced by auxin.
Loss-of Pin6 Function Affects Root Growth
We identified homozygous pin6 mutants for three T-DNA
insertion
alleles
(SALK_092831,
GABI-KAT_430B01
and
GK711C09 referred herein as pin6-4, pin6-5 and pin6-6, respec-
tively) (Fig. 2A). PIN6 mRNA levels were not reduced in pin6-4,
but partially reduced in pin6-5 suggesting a weak loss-of-function
allele (Fig. S3A). pin6-6 represents a stronger loss-of-function
mutant as PIN6 transcripts were not observed flanking the
intronic-T-DNA insertion (Fig. S3B), although PIN6 transcript
levels were still observed in a region upstream from the TDNA
insertion using primers that span the third intron (Fig. S3C and D).
A portion of the PIN6 protein including the hydrophilic loop may
still be translated in pin6-6, however the removal of at least 22
amino acids form the 39 end of the PIN6 protein could perhaps
only partially disrupt protein function.
The hypocotyl and primary root lengths of pin6 mutant alleles
were similar to wild type with a slight reduction of root length in
the pin6-6 allele (Data not shown). Compared to WT, the weaker
pin6-4 and pin6-5 mutant alleles as well as as well as the stronger
pin6-6 allele all showed a similar number of primordia at all seven
stages of lateral root primordia development and primordium
density was similar to wild type (Data not shown).
The recently reported pin6-2 allele represents a complete loss-of-
function allele of PIN6 [40]. Root growth was significantly
enhanced in this line (Fig. 2B). When the number of lateral root
primordia was calculated, we found that there was no difference
when compared to WT. However, a shift in the developmental
stages of the different lateral root primordia was observed with less
primordia in the early stages and more primordia and emerged

lateral roots in the later stages (Fig. 2C and D), indicating a faster
lateral root development.
In conclusion, the data reveal that the complete loss of pin6
function interferes with auxin regulated growth processes in the
root, in particularly lateral root development.
PIN6 Overexpression Results in Stunted Growth and
Reduces Apical Dominance
To understand whether mis- or overexpression of PIN6 could
interfere with auxin related growth processes, we created PIN6
over-expressor lines using the strong 35S promoter (Fig. 3A).
Representative transgenic lines displaying increased PIN6 tran-
script abundance were selected (Fig. 3B) and the three highest
overexpressing lines (PIN6-OE) lines #1, #18 and/or #14 were
used for subsequent analyses. Overexpression of PIN6 resulted in a
compact rosette phenotype (Fig. 3C) and reduced leaf area
(Fig. 3D). The relative leaf area expansion rate of PIN6-OE plants
was less during the first four weeks of growth when compared to
wild type (Fig. S4A). PIN6-OE leaf tissues appeared dark green
and accordingly the chlorophyll content was higher on a fresh
weight basis than in wild type and a reduction in the chlorophyll
a/b ratio was observed (Fig. 3E). PIN6-OE lines flowered 5 to 10
days later, however the number of rosette leaves at the emergence
of the floral bolt was not significantly different from wild type (Fig.
S4B and S4C). Floral development of PIN6-OE lines appeared
stunted when compared to wild type (Fig. 3F). PIN6-OE lines
showed one or two additional rosette and cauline branches (Fig.
S4D and S4E). The overall floral stem height of PIN6-OE lines
was considerably smaller when compared to wild type (Fig. 3G)
and there was a significant increase (,10 fold) in the number of
reproductive siliques along the entire length of the primary floral
stem (Fig. 3H). These observations suggest that rosette develop-
ment, chlorophyll content, fecundity and shoot apical dominance
are affected by PIN6 overexpression.
PIN6 Overexpression Affects Root Waving, Lateral Root
Development and Root Hair Outgrowth
PIN6-OE interfered also with root growth and development
(Fig. 4). The most obvious phenotypes were a pronounced root-
waving phenotype (Fig. 4A and B) and a significant reduction in
root length (Fig. 4C), which translated into much lower root
biomass (Fig. 4D). All roots showed waves of similar amplitude
(Fig. 4E), but instead of the regular, loose waves exhibited by wild
type roots, PIN6-OE roots displayed much tighter waves (Fig. 4F),
occurring at significantly greater frequency, in both spatial and
temporal terms (Fig. 5A and B). Clearly, misexpression of PIN6
altered the root oscillatory elongation patterns.
Another striking feature was the absence of root hair outgrowths
(Fig. 4G). Confocal microscopy of the zone of cell differentiation
showed that trichoblast outgrowths were absent (Fig. 4H), but a
cross-section of the root showed the expected pattern of trichoblast
(H cells) and atrichoblast (N cells) cells in PIN6-OE lines (Fig. 4I).
Since root hair growth is proportional to internal auxin levels in
the root hair cell [59], the data reveal that overexpression of PIN6
might interfere with auxin availability in these cells.
Next we examined lateral and adventitious root development,
both known to involve auxin signalling and homeostasis [34,60].
PIN6-OE seedlings produced fewer lateral roots (Fig. 5C). As
observed for the primary root, lateral roots were shorter than in
wild type (Fig. 5D). Stage distribution of lateral root development

(Fig. 4J) and the comparison between lateral root initiation and
emergence densities (Fig. 4K), indicated a delay in lateral root
emergence. Accordingly, the cellular patterning of lateral root
primordia was altered by PIN6 overexpression when compared to
the wild type (compare Fig. 4O with 4P). The dome shape of the
lateral root primordia is missing and the regular pattern of cell
divisions in developing primordia is perturbed. Eventually lateral
roots emerge but the accumulation of early stage lateral root
primordia and decrease in late stage primordia reveal some delay
in development.
Finally, wild type seedlings occasionally showed one short
adventitious root, while PIN6-OE seedlings produced 2 to 3
adventitious roots (Fig. 5E), which were well elongated (Fig. 5F).
Strikingly, the root waving was especially obvious in both lateral
and adventitious roots, which showed regular and spatially even
waves, while in the primary root waving was more irregular and
intermittent (Fig. 4B). In conclusion, misexpression of PIN6
interferes with root elongation and waving, adventitious and
lateral root development, as well as root hair outgrowth, all of
which
represent
root
growth
processes
dependent
on
the
appropriate auxin levels in the respective tissues.
PIN6 Overexpression Perturbs Ethylene Response
The phytohormone ethylene has been implicated in the control
of root tropisms as well as waving [61] and has been shown to alter
polar auxin transport [62]. We therefore tested whether exogenous
application of 1-aminocyclopropanecarboxylic acid (ACC), the
immediate precursor of ethylene, would affect the PIN6-OE
elongation rate and root-waving habit (Fig. 5). Untreated PIN6-
OE roots were significantly shorter than the wild type counter-
parts, while on ACC, their length was comparable to that of wild
type roots, revealing decreased sensitivity of PIN6-OE root
elongation to ethylene (Fig. 5G). ACC affected the waving of wild
type roots, with a clear decrease in temporal waving frequency,
but a subtle increase in the number of waves per mm of root
(Fig. 5A and B), reflecting slower root elongation rates at higher
concentrations of ACC (10mM). Responses of PIN6-OE lines
followed a similar pattern but differed in magnitude (Fig. 5A and
B); however, in contrast to wild type the root waves became quite
distorted, irregular and somewhat erratic, indicating altered
gravitropism and sensitivity to ethylene compared to wild type
(Fig. 5H to K). ACC reduced the number and length of lateral
roots found on wild type but not PIN6-OE plants (Fig. 5C and D),
suggestive of a reduced sensitivity of lateral root elongation to
ethylene as observed for the primary root (Fig. 5G). Adventitious
root formation was not significantly affected by ACC (Fig. 5E),
however in PIN6-OE plants higher concentrations of ACC
(10mM) caused those roots to elongate more slowly (Fig. 5F),
although this effect was much less severe than in the primary root
(compare Fig. 5F and 5G). Overall these results reveal differential
effects of PIN6 overexpression on ethylene sensitivity during
different developmental processes and provide evidence of a
perturbed ethylene-auxin interaction in the control of the
underlying cellular processes.
PIN6 Affects Auxin Homeostasis, Accumulation and
Transport
As PIN6 overexpression interfered with auxin regulated growth
responses, we tested its effects on auxin transport, homeostasis and
accumulation. An isolated inflorescence stem internode assay was
used to assess the in vivo function of PIN6 as a polar auxin
transporter [44]. The total amount of auxin (3H labelled IAA)
transported through the floral stem segments (similar thickness
between the first and second cauline nodes) was significantly
reduced in PIN6-OE lines when compared to wild type (Fig. 6A).
In contrast, the PIN1 overexpression line [9] showed a significant
increase in total auxin transport (Fig. 6A). In PIN6-OE plants, the
basipetal wave of radioactively labelled auxin showed a slight
increase in auxin transport in the stem segments closest to the 3H-
IAA source (6–15 mm), but a significant decrease in the more
distal
segments
(18–30 mm) (Fig. 6B). The
PIN1-OE
line
displayed a basipetal wave similar to that of wild type (Fig. 6B).
The decrease in basipetal auxin transport through the PIN6-OE
stem could explain the observed defect in apical dominance in the
PIN6 overexpressing plants (Fig. 3).
A relative root growth assay showed that the PIN6-OE seedlings
were less sensitive to IAA and IAA-alanine (Fig. 6C and D). High
concentrations were used for the IAA-alanine conjugate because it
needs to be hydrolysed (in the ER) first to IAA before it can inhibit
root length [45]. An auxin inducible DR5::GUS reporter system
[63] showed that when compared to wild type, stronger DR5
activity was observed in the PIN6-OE root tips and cotyledons
during the early stages of germination (Fig. 6E, F, H and I), as well
as in mature seedling root tips (Fig. 6G and J). The application of
200 nM 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) promoted strong GUS
staining in the cortex and epidermis of wild type roots (Fig. 6K to
M), but not in PIN6-OE roots (Fig. 6N to P), which showed
stronger DR5 activity only in the tips of the emerged lateral roots
(Fig. 6K to P). This shows that overexpression of PIN6 interferes
with the generation of DR5 auxin activity maxima in the roots. A
stronger auxin response maximum in PIN6 overexpressing roots
and root growth resistance to IAA and IAA-alanine suggest that
PIN6 overexpression might interfere with accumulation of auxin
in elongating epidermal and cortical cells.
In conclusion, analysis of PIN6 overexpression revealed a role of
PIN6 in regulating auxin transport and auxin homeostasis.
Discussion
PIN6 Promoter Activity is Regulated in a Tissue-specific
and Auxin Dependent Manner
In general, PIN6 expression was relatively low throughout plant
development and only detected in particular tissues during specific
stages of growth. For instance, in mature embryos, PIN6 was
expressed in the root tip and root vasculature, whereas PIN6
expression in these tissues was relatively low in seedlings. Here,
PIN6 expression was associated with the margins of the lateral root
primordia as shown previously [20] and accumulated asymmet-
rically during root growth. PIN6 expression levels were generally
strongest in meristematic tissues and at the boundaries of root and
floral organs (Fig. 1). The low expression levels of PIN6 are in
accordance with the presence of the epigenetic mark H3K27m3
that was enriched surrounding the PIN6 promoter and gene
regions. H3K27m3 has been shown to reduce gene expression
levels and could contribute to the low PIN6 transcript levels (Figure
S2). Auxin induced PIN6::GUS expression in the shoot meristem,
inner root tissues of the stele (including the pericycle), endodermis
and
root
apical
meristem
(Fig.
1).
Consistent
with
these
observations a number of auxin response elements were identified
within the PIN6 promoter. Therefore, although PIN6 is relatively
weakly expressed in most tissues, the PIN6 promoter is responsive
to developmental cues in a tissue-specific and auxin-dependent
manner.
The most important outstanding question concerns the subcel-
lular localization of PIN6. PIN proteins with longer central
hydrophilic loop have been shown to be localized at the PM,
whereas so called shorter PINs with reduced hydrophilic loop are
localized to the ER [12]. PIN6 in terms of protein topology

represents an intermediate type of PIN proteins with middle-sized
hydrophilic loop and thus it is difficult to envision how this type of
PIN protein will be localized. The transient expression of PIN6-
GFP in tobacco cells suggests an intracellular, non-PM localization
of PIN6 [10]. In accordance, the PIN6 gain-of-function analysis
showing effects on auxin homeostasis and largely distinct effects on
auxin transport as compared to PIN1 gain-of-function (Fig. 6A and
B) support a scenario that PIN6 is playing a role distinct from PM-
localized PIN proteins. Nonetheless, the definitive answer to the in
vivo subcellular localization of PIN6 awaits future characterisation.
The Loss of PIN6 Function Affects Lateral Root
Development
None of the identified pin6 mutants in this study affected auxin
regulated root growth. Accordingly, PIN6 mRNA levels were not
or only slightly reduced in the pin6-4 and pin6-5 mutants. The pin6-
6 T-DNA insertion is predicted to remove at least 22 amino acids
from the 39 end of the PIN6 protein. Although full PIN6
transcripts, (flanking the T-DNA insertion) were not detected,
the observed transcripts in a region upstream to the T-DNA
insertion together with a lack of root phenotype suggest that these
22 last amino acids do not contribute significantly to the
functionality of the protein. In contrast, the complete loss of
PIN6 activity in pin6-2 allele [40] did affect root growth and lateral
root development. Less primordia in the early stages, together with
a higher proportion of primordia in the later developmental stages,
suggest a faster development of lateral roots in absence of PIN6.
Accordingly, PIN6 promoter activity was recorded throughout all
the different stages of lateral root organogenesis. Together, the
data indicate that auxin regulated root growth, in particular lateral
root development requires PIN6 activity.
PIN6 Overexpression Alters Auxin Homeostasis and Plant
Development
Misexpression of PIN6 using the CaMV 35S promoter showed
that PIN6 also interferes with other growth processes that require
correct distribution of auxin. In photosynthetic tissues, the
overexpression
of
PIN6
increased
leaf
chlorophyll
content,
promoted a compact rosette, reduced floral stem height and
enhanced the emergence of seed nurturing siliques (Fig. 3). In the
root, PIN6 overexpression promoted adventitious root formation
and root waving, while also perturbing root elongation, lateral
primordia development as well as inhibiting the emergence of
trichoblast hair cells (Fig. 4). Auxin has been shown to promote
adventitious root formation and while the RNA interference of
OsPIN1 significantly inhibited adventitious root development in
rice [60,64], the overexpression of AtPIN6 promoted the formation
of adventitious roots (Fig. 5). The root-wave phenotype has been
well characterised in the main Arabidopsis root [25,61] being
linked with distortion of polar auxin transport. Waving of lateral
roots has been linked to light/dark cycles [65], while waving of
adventitious roots has not yet been reported. The very pronounced
waving of lateral and adventitious roots compared to the main
root, and accumulation of auxin in the root wave crests, indicate
altered auxin gradients and homeostasis interfering with the
endogenous root tropisms. As noted above pin2 mutations reduced
root waving [27], while to date the overexpression of PIN proteins
has not enhanced root waving, revealing this is likely to be specific
to PIN6.
Overexpression of PIN6 in lateral root primordia also indicated
that misexpression of PIN6 interferes with primordia development.
In PIN6 overexpressing lines, more primordia in the early and less
primordia in the later stages of development were observed. This
was consistent with a perturbation in the cellular patterning of root
primordia caused by PIN6 overexpression (Fig. 4) and contrasts
nicely with the pin6 loss-of-function phenotype, where a faster
development was observed (Fig. 2). The overexpression of PIN6
affected the auxin response maximum in developing primordia,
indicating
that
altered
auxin
homeostasis
induced
by
the
overexpression of PIN6 can interfere with lateral root develop-
ment.
The tubular outgrowth of a root epidermal cell that produces a
root hair can be divided into three stages, 1) fate determination to
become a hair (H) or nonhair cell (N), 2) hair initiation, and 3) hair
elongation [66]. Auxin is a potent stimulator of trichoblast
initiation and elongation but appears to have much less effect
upon cell fate–determining process [66,67]. The overexpression of
PIN6 perturbed the outgrowth of the root hair cell, however did
not affect fate determination as sections from the PIN6-OE
primary root showed potential H and N cells, typical of wild type
roots (Fig. 4). The perturbation of polar auxin efflux through the
overexpression of other long- and short-looped PINs as well as
PID proteins [59,68] was also shown to affect root hair
development. It seems likely that PIN6 overexpression reduces
the level of auxin in the trichoblast cell. This would be consistent
with the hypothesis that auxin efflux inhibits, and auxin influx
enhances, the outgrowth of the root hair cell [69].
Evidence that PIN6 misexpression modulates auxin homeostasis
during growth and development was also provided by the altered
DR5 auxin response activity in roots overexpressing PIN6 and the
failure of auxin to induce DR5::GUS activity in the outer cell layers
of the root, leading to different GUS expression patterns (Fig. 1
and 6). Consistent with these observations our root growth assays
confirmed a lower sensitivity to auxin conjugates when compared
to wild type (Fig. 6). Given that PIN6 might localize to the ER,
where enzymes involved in IAA metabolism are compartmental-
ized [70] it could be involved in regulating cellular auxin
homoeostasis, presumably by compartmentalizing auxin between
the ER and the cytosol and thereby fine-tune the cellular free IAA
levels.
PIN6 was shown to function as an auxin (IAA) transporter in
tobacco Bright Yellow-2 cell lines [9]. Here we show that
overexpression of PIN6 reduces total auxin transport through the
Arabidopsis inflorescence stem (Fig. 6). The slight increase in the
basipetal wave of radioactively labelled auxin nearest the 3H-IAA
source relative to the significant decrease in the more distal
segments, perhaps reflects a role for PIN6 as a regulator of inter-
cellular movement of auxin efflux in vivo. For example, PIN6 could
transport auxin in the opposite direction or in a non-polar
manner, alternatively it might sequester auxin intracellularly by
transporting auxin into ER thus limiting its availability for
intercellular transport. Future experiments should address how
PIN6 overexpression affects auxin transport activity.
PIN6 Misexpression Affects Ethylene Responses
Auxin and ethylene synergistically interact to coordinate root
elongation with both hormones inhibiting the elongation of cells
leaving the RAM [71,72,73,74] (Fig. 5). Ethylene induced
inhibition of root growth was reduced by PIN6 misexpression as
the root length in the PIN6-OE lines was less sensitive to ACC
than in wild type, for both primary and lateral roots (Fig. 5).
Interestingly, the reduction in root length appeared to be caused
by early inhibitory effects of PIN6 in the first 10 days of growth, as
the relative elongation rate thereafter was similar between
overexpression and wild type lines (data not shown). Ethylene
was shown to reduce temporal wave frequency significantly on
nutrient-supplemented agar [61]; so did ACC here in both wild

type and PIN6 overexpressing lines (Fig. 5). The misexpression of
PIN6 however caused waves to become distorted, asymmetric and
irregular, with the trajectory of root elongation showing strong
deviations from the vertical. Therefore, the overexpression of PIN6
reduces the sensitivity of the root to ethylene.
Ethylene regulates root growth by stimulating auxin biosynthe-
sis and basipetal auxin transport toward the elongation zone,
where it activates a local auxin response leading to inhibition of
cell elongation [73,74]. In mutants affected in basipetal auxin
transport, ethylene cannot activate the auxin response or inhibit
root elongation [74]. Given that PIN6 overexpression lines have
some resistance to ethylene (Fig. 5) it is possible that the
misexpression of PIN6 interferes with basipetal auxin transport.
Consistently, a strong auxin response maximum at the root tip in
PIN6 overexpressors (Fig. 1 and 6), resembles auxin accumulation
pattern in pin2/eir1-1 mutants reported to have defects in basipetal
auxin flow in the root [17]. Collectively, these data demonstrate
that the misexpression of PIN6 can perturb auxin transport
dependent ethylene regulation of root growth.
Conclusion
The pin6 loss-of-function and misexpression lines demonstrated
that PIN6 in Arabidopsis plays important developmental and
physiological roles. We demonstrated that PIN6 expression can be
regulated by auxin and developmental cues and that PIN6
modifies auxin transport resulting in altered auxin dependent
processes, especially those required for root growth and repro-
ductive development.
