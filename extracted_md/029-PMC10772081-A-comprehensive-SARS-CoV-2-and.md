Abstract
The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is reported to cause apoptosis of infected cells and several
of its proteins including the 3a accessory protein, are pro-apoptotic. Since the 3a protein localizes to the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER)-Golgi compartment, its role in causing ER stress was investigated in transiently transfected cells. Cells
expressing the 3a proteins showed ER stress based on activation of genes for the ER chaperones GRP78 and GRP94. Since ER
stress can cause differential modulation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), which includes the inositol-requiring
enzyme 1 (IRE-1), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) pathways, these were individually
tested in 3a-expressing cells. Only the PERK pathway was found to be activated in 3a-expressing cells based on (1) increased
phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2a) and inhibitory effects of a dominant-negative form of eIF2a
on GRP78 promoter activity, (2) increased translation of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) mRNA, and (3) ATF4-
dependent activation of the C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) gene promoter. Activation of PERK affects innate immunity
by suppression of type 1 interferon (IFN) signaling. The 3a protein was found to induce serine phosphorylation within the
IFN alpha-receptor subunit 1 (IFNAR1) degradation motif and to increase IFNAR1 ubiquitination. Confocal microscopic
analysis showed increased translocation of IFNAR1 into the lysosomal compartment and flow cytometry showed reduced
levels of IFNAR1 in 3a-expressing cells. These results provide further mechanistic details of the pro-apoptotic effects of the
SARS-CoV 3a protein, and suggest a potential role for it in attenuating interferon responses and innate immunity.

Introduction
A new virus, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona-
virus (SARS-CoV), was responsible for an outbreak of acute
respiratory illness in 2003, which affected about 30 countries with
over 8000 cumulative infections and more than 900 deaths [1].
The SARS-CoV is a positive-stranded RNA virus with an ,30 kb
genome [2,3]. Compared to other human and animal coronavi-
ruses, the SARS-CoV genome consists of 9 unique open reading
frames (orfs) [4]. Of these, orf3a is the largest and encodes a protein
of 274 amino acids. The 3a protein is part of the virus particle, is
expressed abundantly in infected as well as transfected cells,
localizes to intracellular and plasma membranes [5], and induces
apoptosis in transfected and infected cells [6,7].
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) regulates cellular metabolism
and protein synthesis in response to perturbations in protein
synthesis and folding. Since the ER is the site for translation and
processing of proteins destined for secretion or membrane
insertion, many viruses, including the SARS-CoV exploit this
organelle. During viral replication there is high biosynthetic
burden on the cell for producing viral proteins. The accumulation
of nascent and unfolded viral secretory and transmembrane
proteins in the ER lumen can lead to ER stress and the
downstream activation of multiple signaling pathways [8]. To
adjust the biosynthetic burden and capacity of the ER for
maintaining cellular homeostasis, the Unfolded Protein Response
(UPR) is activated. The UPR is a complex pathway that is
mediated by three distinct signaling tracks initiated by the sensors
inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE-1), activating transcription factor
6 (ATF6) and PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) [9]. These proteins
transduce adaptive signals to the cytosol and nucleus, leading to
global effects on ER function [10] and recovery from ER stress.
But, prolonged ER stress can also trigger apoptosis.
Viruses have developed various strategies to modulate the UPR
[11–14]. The hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes increased transcrip-
tion from the glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and GRP94
promoters through the activation of PERK and ATF6 pathways
[15,16,17], with simultaneous suppression of the IRE1-X box
binding protein (XBP1) pathway [18]. The human cytomegalo-
virus (CMV) affects UPR through activation of the PERK and

IRE-1 branches but spares the ATF6 pathway [19,20]. A
cytopathic strain of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) induces
apoptosis through UPR by activating the PERK pathway [21].
The S protein of SARS-CoV modulates UPR by the transcrip-
tional activation of GRP78/94 and upregulation of the PERK
pathway, but has little or no effect on the other two arms of UPR
[4]. Since the 3a protein of SARS-CoV is also a transmembrane
protein that localizes to the ER-Golgi region and plasma
membranes of cells and induces apoptosis, we studied its effects
on ER stress and UPR.
Type1 interferon (IFN) signaling exerts anti-proliferative and
anti-viral effects through a cell surface cognate receptor consisting
of two subunits, the interferon alpha receptor subunit 1 (IFNAR1)
and IFNAR2 [22]. Dimerization of these receptor subunits in
response to the binding of type I interferons (IFNa or IFNb) causes
the activation of Janus kinase (Jak) family members, Jak1 and
Tyk2, which eventually activate the signal transducers and
activators of transcription (Stat1 and Stat2) proteins [23]. The
Stat proteins cause transcriptional activation of IFN-regulated
genes. The cell surface downmodulation and ensuing degradation
of the IFN receptor in response to IFNa treatment is a crucial
event in limiting the extent of interferon-mediated cellular
responses [24,25]. The mechanism involves ligand-induced Tyk2
activity-dependent [26,27,28,29] or ligand-and Jak-independent
[30] phosphorylation of the Ser535 residue in the degradation
motif (degron) of IFNAR1, which is followed by its ubiquitination
and lysosomal degradation [26].
Activation of the PERK arm of UPR affects innate immunity of
a cell by accelerating degradation of the IFNAR1 subunit; during
infections by vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and the hepatitis C
virus (HCV) this reduces the sensitivity of the infected cell to IFN
[31]. The degradation signal is phosphorylation of a serine residue
within the IFNAR1 degron, which leads to increased ubiquitina-
tion and receptor degradation through the lysosomal pathway in
virus infected cells [31]. In the current study we present evidence
that the 3a protein of SARS-CoV elicits UPR by modulating the
PERK pathway, and this leads to phosphorylation, ubiquitination
and lysosomal degradation of IFNAR1.
Results
The SARS-CoV 3a Protein Induces ER Stress
The SARS-CoV utilizes the ER for processing its structural and
nonstructural proteins [32]. During viral replication, substantial
amounts of viral transmembrane glycoproteins such as the spike
(S) and matrix (M) proteins are produced [32], of which the S
protein induces ER stress [4]. Since the 3a protein is also a
transmembrane glycoprotein that localizes to the ER-Golgi
compartments, we studied its potential to induce ER stress.
To investigate this, we looked at the transcriptional activation of
grp78 and grp94 genes, which encode crucial ER chaperones that
are markers of ER stress, in cells expressing the 3a protein. To rule
out induction of ER stress merely due to over-expression of a viral
protein, we also studied the effects of the HIV proteins Nef and
Vpu, and the hepatitis E virus (HEV) Orf3 protein, on grp78 and
grp94 activation. A luciferase reporter construct driven by the
grp78 promoter and either plasmid pSGI, pEGFP, pEYFP (vector
controls) or pSGI-3a-HA, pEGFP-Vpu, pEGFP-Orf3 or pEYFP-
Nef were transiently transfected into Huh7 cells. The cells were
harvested 48 hr post-transfection for measurement of luciferase
activity. We observed about 3 to 4 fold increase in luciferase
activity in 3a expressing cells as compared to the vector control
cells. The transient expression of HIV Vpu also gave a similar
increase in grp78 promoter activity, HIV Nef did not show any
effect, and HEV Orf 3 showed about 2.5 fold reduction in grp78
promoter activity (Fig. 1A). We also tested the effects of the SARS-
CoV 3a protein on grp78 promoter in two other cell lines, COS
and Vero cells, and observed similar effects as in Huh7 cells
(Fig. 1A). Activation of the grp94 promoter by the SARS-CoV 3a
protein was also tested in Huh7 and COS cells. This promoter was
also activated about 3 to 4 folds by expression of the 3a protein
(Fig. 1B). These results using two different ER sensor reporters,
multiple cell lines and other viral proteins as controls, suggest that
the 3a protein causes ER stress.
The 3a Protein Differentially Activates the PERK but Not
the IRE-1 and ATF6 Branches of UPR
Since ER stress leads to activation of UPR, which comprises of
three different branches, we tested for the effects of 3a expression
on each of these. The IRE-1 and ATF6 pathways lead to
reprogramming of the cell and induction of ER associated
degradation [33,34,35]. Following the activation of IRE-1 by
ER stress, its endoribonuclease activity causes unconventional
splicing of the mRNA for the X box-binding protein 1 (XBP-1).
To determine the effect of 3a expression on the IRE-1 pathway,
we carried out reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) for the spliced XBP-1 mRNA as described elsewhere
[36]. The spliced XBP-1 RNA was not observed in vector control
or 3a-expressing cells, but was present in cells treated with
thapsigargin, a chemical inducer of ER stress (Fig. 2A). During ER
stress, ATF6 is translocated to the Golgi where its cytoplasmic
domain (ATF6f) is liberated by regulated proteolysis [37,38]. To
study the effect of 3a expression on the ATF6 pathway, we looked
at the levels of ATF6f following cotransfection of a FLAG-tagged
ATF6 expression plasmid that mimicked ATF6 processing upon
induction of ER stress, and either the empty pSGI vector or the
pSGI-3a-HA expression vector. We did not observe any significant
increase in the cleaved ATF6f (p50) product arising from
transfected FLAG-tagged ATF6 (p90) in 3a expressing cells as
compared to control cells; however, treatment with thapsigargin
led to increased levels of the p50 form (not shown).
Under conditions of ER stress the kinase activity of PERK is
activated, phosphorylating its downstream target, the eukaryotic
translation initiation factor 2 subunit a (eIF2a). To test if 3a
protein-mediated ER stress was through the PERK pathway, we
first looked at the phosphorylation status of eIF2a by western
blotting of transfected cell lysates. Compared to control cells, the
3a-expressing cells showed increased levels of phospho-eIF2a
(peIF2a) without a concomitant increase in total eIF2a levels
(Fig. 2B). We then cotransfected cells with expression plasmids for
wild type eIF2a or its dominant-negative (DN) or dominant active
(DA) mutants, pGRP78-Luc and either pSGI or pSG-3a-HA.
Since the DN form of eIF2a constitutively inhibits phosphoryla-
tion of eIF2a, the promoter activity of GRP78/94 would be
compromised. We observed that the induction of ER stress in 3a
expressing cells, measured with the grp78-luc reporter, was
compromised in the presence of eIF2a DN (Fig. 2C), confirming
the role of 3a protein in activating the PERK-eIF2a pathway.
While PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2a leads to a
decrease in its activity, it also causes a paradoxical increase in
translation of ATF4 mRNA [39,40,41]. The ATF4 protein is a
transcription factor that binds to and activates the promoter of C/
EBP homologous protein (CHOP, also called as GADD153) gene
[39,40,41]. To investigate the effect of 3a and other viral proteins
on downstream effectors of the PERK pathway, we employed the
construct TK.mATF4.UTR.Luc.pGL3, which contains the 59-
untranslated region of ATF4 fused to the coding region of firefly
luciferase, for studying ATF4 translation in transiently transfected

cells. There was about 17-fold increase in ATF4 expression in 3a-
expressing cells compared to control cells; the other viral proteins
did not show any significant effect on ATF4 translation (Fig. 3A).
The activity of the CHOP promoter was also assayed in cells
cotransfected with the pSGI-3a-HA expression construct (or pSGI)
and a luciferase reporter construct driven by CHOP promoter.
There was an ,4-fold increase in CHOP promoter activity in 3a-
expressing cells (Fig. 3B); the other viral proteins showed variable
results. The HEV Orf3 protein showed a decrease in CHOP
promoter activity, whereas the HIV Nef and Vpu proteins and the
HBV X protein showed marginal increases in the CHOP
promoter activity (Fig. 3B).
Since activation of the CHOP promoter can also be mediated
by the p38 MAPK pathway and our earlier results show that the
3a protein can also activate this pathway, we employed SB203580,
a chemical inhibitor of the p38 MAPK to dissect the effects of the
3a protein on CHOP activation. The CHOP promoter-reporter
construct was cotransfected into cells with either the 3a expression
plasmid (or the vector control plasmid). One set of transfected
cultures was treated with SB203580, while the other was treated

transfections.

with the vehicle (DMSO). Luciferase assays carried out on cell
lysates did not reveal any significant effect of SB203580 on the
activity of the CHOP promoter in 3a expressing cells at
concentrations that inhibit p38 activity (Fig. 3C). This shows that
transcriptional activation of CHOP expression by the 3a protein
was independent of its activation of the p38 MAPK pathway.
The 3a Protein Promotes Phosphorylation, Ubiquitination
and Lysosomal Degradation of the Interferon-Alpha
Receptor Subunit 1 (IFNAR1)
The activation of PERK causes phosphorylation of IFNAR1
within its degron region; this is important for its ubiquitination and
downregulation at the cell surface [31]. To investigate the fate of
IFNAR1 in 3a expressing cells, we first looked at its phosphor-
ylation levels. Increased IFNAR1 phosphorylation was observed in
3a expressing cells, compared to control cells (Fig. 4A). As a
positive control, tunicamycin, a chemical inducer of ER stress also
showed increased IFNAR1 phosphorylation. There was also a
slight decrease in the steady state levels of the IFNAR1 protein in
cells that were either treated with tunicamycin or expressed the 3a
protein (Fig. 4A). This would indicate either decreased synthesis or
increased degradation of the IFNAR1 protein under these
conditions. Since IFNAR1 phosphorylation is established as a
signal for its ubiquitination, we tested for that by immunoprecip-
itating lysates from transiently transfected cells with anti-IFNAR1
antibodies and then western blotting the precipitates with an anti-
ubiquitin antibody. Compared to control cells, the 3a expressing
cells showed increased ubiquitination of the IFNAR1 protein
(Fig. 4B).
Ubiquitinated IFNAR1 is destined to undergo degradation
through a lysosomal pathway [26,42,43]. To test for this, we took
cells transiently expressing either the enhanced cyan fluorescent
protein (ECFP) as a control or the 3a-ECFP-fusion protein, and
co-stained

a loading control. (B) Huh7 cells were transfected with 1 mg of either pSGI or pSGI-3a-HA; untransfected cells were treated with 1.5 mM dithiothreitol

separated by SDS-PAGE and western blotted for the indicated proteins. (C) Huh7 cells were co-transfected with the grp78-luc reporter plasmid

After 48 hr, cell lysates were prepared, normalized and analyzed for luciferase activity. Each bar is representative of two separate experiments, each
with three independent transfections. All the transfections were carried out in 12-well plates.

quantitated. There was increased localization of IFNAR1 in the
lysosomal compartment in 3a expressing cells compared to control
cells (Fig. 5).
Increased ubiquitination and lysosomal translocation of IF-
NAR1 in 3a expressing cells is likely to result in reduced IFNAR1
levels in these cells. We tested this by staining for IFNAR1 in a
flow cytometric assay using cells transiently expressing either the
control ECFP or the 3a-ECFP-fusion protein. As shown in Fig. 6,
there was a significant decrease in the equilibrium levels of
IFNAR1 in 3a-ECFP expressing cells compared to control cells.
To verify involvement of the lysosomal pathway in reduced
IFNAR1 levels, we also treated 3a-ECFP expressing cells with the
lysosomal inhibitor, 3-methyl adenine (3-MA), which led to an
increase in the cellular IFNAR1 signal (Fig. 6), thus confirming a
role for the lysosomal pathway in its reduction in 3a expressing
cells.
Discussion
The 3a protein of SARS-CoV has multiple functions. It has an
ion channel activity [44], modulates trafficking properties of
SARS-CoV spike (S) protein [5], upregulates the expression of
Figure 3. The 3a protein activates the PERK pathway. The (A) ATF4-UTR-luc or (B) CHOP-luc plasmids (0.25 mg each), which express luciferase
under control of the ATF4 untranslated region or the CHOP gene promoter, respectively, were co-transfected in Huh7 cells together with 0.75 mg of
plasmid pSGI-HA, pEGFP, pEYFP or pIRES-EGFP (as controls) or pSGI-3a-HA, pEGFP-Vpu, pEGFP-Orf3, pEYFP-Nef, pIRES-GFP-XO (as test). (C) The grp78-
luc reporter plasmids (0.25 mg each) were co-transfected in Huh7 with either plasmid pSGI-HA (vector control) or pSGI-3a-HA (0.75 mg each), except
that one set of cells were treated with 20 mM SB203580 for 12 hr before harvest, while the controls were treated with the same volume of DMSO. Cell
lysates were prepared 48 hr post-transfection, and normalized lysates were analyzed for luciferase activity. Each bar is representative of two separate
experiments, each with three independent transfections, which were carried out in 12-well plates. In (C), the p value for comparisons between
untreated and SB203580-treated pSGI-3a-HA transfected cells was calculated to be 0.345.

fibrinogen in A549 lung epithelial cells [45] and induces apoptosis
in various cell types in vitro and in vivo [6,46].
All viruses encode proteins that are synthesized by the host cell
and are processed through the cellular protein translocation
machinery. This puts an added burden on the ER, resulting in ER
stress. To overcome the effects of ER stress, many viruses,
including coronaviruses, modulate the UPR [47]. The S protein of
SARS-CoV that forms its surface coat, is produced in large
amounts in infected cells and is trafficked through the ER,
modulates UPR [4]. The 3a protein is another viral transmem-
brane glycoprotein expressed in SARS-CoV infected cells, which
has previously been shown to localize to the ER-Golgi network
and plasma membrane in cells [5], and to viral particles. We show
here that the 3a protein also induces UPR.
In the cell, UPR progresses through three different pathways
that are mediated by IRE-1, ATF6 and PERK. The IRE-1 and
ATF6 pathways lead to reprogramming of the cell and induction
of ER associated degradation, which reduces burden on the ER
[33,34,35]. IRE-1 is a type I transmembrane protein kinase
endoribonuclease [48,49] containing three ER stress-regulated
domains, which include a lumenal dimerization domain, a
cytosolic kinase and an endoribonuclease [50]. Following ER
stress, IRE-1 dimerizes and undergoes autophosphorylation and
activation of its endoribonuclease activity. This causes unconven-
tional splicing of the IRE-1 effector X box-binding protein 1
(XBP-1) mRNA that encodes XBP-1, a basic leucine zipper (bZIP)
transcription factor and belongs to ATF/CREB family [51,52,53].
The ATF6 is a type II transmembrane protein whose cytosolic
domain is a bZIP transcription factor [37]. During ER stress it is
translocated to the Golgi [54], where its cytoplasmic domain
(ATF6f) is liberated by regulated proteolysis and translocates into
the nucleus to activate transcription [37,38]. Our results show
neither XBP-1 mRNA splicing nor ATF6 proteolysis in 3a
expressing cells, suggesting that the IRE-1 and ATF6 pathways are
not activated in these cells.
We did however find activation of the PERK pathway of UPR
by the 3a protein. On activation, the PERK kinase causes
phosphorylation of eIF2a, which leads to reduced translation of
cellular proteins, but stimulates expression of ER molecular
chaperones such as GRP78 and GRP94 [55]. Modulation of UPR
by the 3a protein represents another function aimed at regulating
the cellular response. Increased transcriptional activation and
biosynthesis of ER chaperones would enhance folding of the 3a
and other viral proteins in the ER lumen. The induction of
Endoplasmic Reticulum Associated Degredation (ERAD) to
reduce the protein-folding load on the ER requires activation of
the
IRE1/XBP1
and
ATF6
pathways.
This
includes
ER
degradation-enhancing
a-mannosidase-like
protein
(EDEM),
which is directly involved in recognition and targeting of unfolded
proteins for degradation during UPR [33]. By activating only the
PERK, but not the IRE-1 and ATF6 pathways during UPR, the
3a protein potentially protects itself and other viral proteins from
ERAD, while promoting the expression of ER chaperones and
folding of proteins that have accumulated in the ER.
We showed earlier that the 3a protein activates p38 MAPK and
is proapoptotic [7]. The expression of C/EBP homologous protein
(CHOP), which is known to have a pro-apoptotic effect, is
activated by p38 MAPK as well as through the PERK signaling
pathway
[56,57].
The
over-expression
of
CHOP
leads
to
translocation of Bax from the cytosol to the mitochondria [58].
The CHOP-mediated death signal is finally transmitted to the
mitochondria, which functions as an integrator and amplifier of
the death pathway but the other mechanistic details of CHOP
action are still unclear [57]. We show the 3a protein to cause
increased phosphorylation of eIF2a, which is indicative of
activation of the PERK arm of UPR [55,59]. The activation of
downstream effectors such as ATF4 and CHOP indicates yet
another mechanism through which the 3a protein can be pro-
apoptotic. Since the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 showed no
significant effect on transcriptional activation of the CHOP
promoter in 3a expressing cells, the p38 MAPK pathway is not
likely to mediate these effects of the 3a protein. Overall, our results
show that 3a-expressing cells respond to ER stress by activation of
the PERK pathway, which enhances protein folding in the ER
instead of activating ERAD, the latter being detrimental to virion
biosynthesis. However, prolonged PERK activation would lead to
apoptosis.
Since our approach was based on transient transfection, it was
important to rule out ER stress effects simply due to over-
expression of the SARS-CoV 3a protein. Therefore other viral

proteins were also tested for upstream (grp78 promoter activation)
and downstream (ATF4, CHOP) markers of ER stress. The HIV-
1 Vpu protein being a type I transmembrane protein [59] caused
grp78 promoter activation but it did not significantly affect
downstream effectors of the PERK pathway. The HIV-1 Nef
protein, a membrane-anchored protein also did not show any
significant effects on ER stress. The HBV X protein has been
shown to cause ER stress [60]; in our studies it caused mild
activation of ATF4 and CHOP. Finally, the HEV Orf3 protein,
which associates with cytoskeletal and mebrane fractions [61],
showed
a
reduction
in
ER
stress
measured
through
the
transcriptional activation of grp78 and to a lesser extent that of
CHOP. Interestingly, another protein of this virus, the Orf2
protein, was earlier shown to cause ER stress [62]. Thus, our
results clearly show specific activation of ER stress and the PERK
signaling pathway by the SARS-CoV 3a protein.
The co-evolution of viruses with their hosts has also led to viral
evasion strategies, including those that limit the effects of innate
and adaptive immunity [63]. An important innate response
following viral infection is the synthesis and action of interferons
[64]. Interferons (IFN) are synthesized and secreted by infected
cells, and act on neighboring cells to elicit a variety of protective
responses that limit the further spread of viral infection [64]. For
interferons to act on cells, they must first bind their cognate
receptors on the cell surface [65,66]. Not surprisingly, therefore,
one viral evasion mechanism is down regulation of the IFN
receptor. Recently, ligand-independent downregulation of type I
IFN signaling was observed in virus-infected cells [31]. This
involved PERK activation during UPR causing the phosphoryla-
tion-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of IFNAR1. Since
the 3a protein also activated PERK and its downstream effectors,
we tested the effects of this viral protein on IFNAR1. Our results
showed ligand (IFN)-independent phosphorylation and ubiquiti-
nation of IFNAR1 in 3a expressing cells, increased translocation of
IFNAR1 to the lysosomal compartment for degradation and
reduced levels in these cells.
The hepatitis C virus (HCV) expresses viral proteins that cause
ER stress [67], and HCV-induced UPR promotes IFNAR1
phosphorylation, ubiquitination and downregulation [31]. The
vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) also evokes a similar response [31].
Our results suggest that the SARS-CoV 3a protein might
specifically inhibit type I IFN signaling and antiviral defenses
thereby making 3a expressing or virus-infected cells less sensitive to
IFNa. Interestingly, the treatment of SARS patients with only
Figure 5. The 3a protein increases lysosomal accumulation of IFNAR1. Huh7 cells were grown on coverslips placed in the wells of 6-well
dishes and transfected with 2.5 mg of plasmid pECFP or p3a-ECFP. After 48 hr, the cells were washed and stained with Lysotracker as well as an anti-
IFNAR1 antibody, as described in Materials and Methods. The cells were then imaged with a confocal microscope, the images quantitated and
colocalization coefficients calculated as described. Separate images for Lysotracker (red), IFNAR1 (green) and ECFP/3a-ECFP (cyan) are shown,
together with merged images for Lysotracker and IFNAR1. Scale bar, 10 mm. The bar graph shows Pearson’s colocalization coefficients; p = 1.861027.

IFNa is also reported to have shown low efficacy during the 2003
outbreak [68].
We propose here that the 3a protein of SARS-CoV induces
degradation of IFNAR1 and elicits apoptotic conditions by
transcriptional upregulation of CHOP through differential activa-
tion of the PERK arm of UPR. Further studies are needed,
especially in an animal model of disease, to confirm the extent of
these effects in SARS-CoV pathogenesis.
Materials and Methods
Materials, Plasmids and Primers
All common reagents were from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis,
MO, USA) unless stated otherwise. COS-1 and Vero cells were
obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, Va,
USA), and Huh7 cells were from Dr. J. Sato, Okayama University,
Japan. All cell lines were cultured at 37uC in 10% CO2 in
complete Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM containing
1 g/lit glucose, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1.5 g/lit sodium bicarbonate,
0.1 mM non-essential amino acids, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin,
100 U penicillin) and 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Antibodies
generated against a recombinant 3a protein have been described
previously [69]. The ATF6 and IRE-1a reagents were kindly
provided by Ron Prywes, Columbia University, New York [70],
the ATF4 and eIF2a reagents were from David Ron, NYU
Medical Center, New York, the pCHOP-Luc reporter plasmid
containing human C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) promoter
was from Nai Sum Wong, Faculty of Medicine, University of
Hong Kong [71], and the pGRP78-Luc and pGRP94-Luc
reporter constructs were from Kazutoshi Mori, Kyoto University,
Japan [72]. Antibodies to phospho-eIF2a and eIF2a were from
Cell Signaling Technology and the IFNAR1 and anti-Ubiquitin
antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The cloning of
orf3a and construction of the pSGI-3a-HA and p3a-ECFP
expression vectors has been described previously [69]. The cloning
of other viral proteins like Nef [73], Vpu [74], HEV Orf 3 [75]
and HBV X [76] has been described elsewhere. The primers for
amplifying unspliced (u) and spliced (s) forms of XBP-1 transcripts
were: 59-TTACGAG AGAAAACTCATGGC-39 and 59-GGGT-
CCAAGTTGTCCAGAATGC-39, and amplification was accord-
ing to the protocol described elsewhere [77]. Histone transcripts
were amplified with the primers 59-TGAGAGACAACATTCA-
GGGCATCAC -39 and 59-CGCTTGAGCGCGTACACCACA-
TCCAT-39.
Transfection and Immunoblotting
Tranfections were done with the Fugene 6 reagent (Roche,
Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. At the indicated times post-transfection, cells were scraped,
lysed and processed as described previously [7]. The protein
concentration of the lysate was estimated using Bradford regeant
(Bio-Rad), and immunoblotting was carried out as described
previously [69].
Luciferase Reporter Assays
Transfected cells were harvested after 48 hrs and lysed in the
cell lysis buffer (Luciferase Assay Kit; Promega, Madison, WI,
USA). Normalized cell lysates were analyzed for luciferase activity
according to the supplier’s protocol and readings were taken on a
luminometer (Sirius, Berthold, Germany).
Immunoprecipitation
Transfected cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA,
1% Triton X-100, 1 mM NaF, 1 mM sodium orthovandate and
a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). The
lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 16,0006g for 20 min at
4uC. Protein quantitation was done by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad
Laboratories). For immunoprecipitation of phosphoprotein, 0.7
to 1 mg of total protein in 400–500 ml lysis buffer was first
incubated with 20 ml of Protein G-agarose beads (GE Health-
care, Uppsala, Sweden) for 1 hr at 4uC. The pre-cleared lysate
was then incubated with 2 mg of the antibody overnight at 4uC,
followed by 20 ml of equilibrated Protein G-agarose beads for
3 hr at 4uC. After washing five times in lysis buffer, the beads
were boiled in Laemmli buffer, the proteins were separated by
SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting as described previously
[69].
Figure 6. The 3a protein reduces endogenous levels of IFNAR1. Huh7 cells in 60 mm dishes were transfected with 2.5 mg of either pECFP or
p3a-ECFP. In one set, the p3a-ECFP transfected cells were also treated with 20 mM 3-MA for 1 hr prior to harvest. The cells were harvested 48 hr post-
transfection and endogenous levels of IFNAR1 were analyzed by flow cytometry as described in Materials and Methods. The mean fluorescence
intensity (MFI) of IFNAR1 signal was estimated and p values shown were calculated with the Student’s T test. The flow cytometry plot is
representative of three separate experiments, while the MFI values shown are an average (6SD) of these experiments.

Imunofluorescence and Subcellular Localization
For transient transfection, cells were grown on coverslips to 40–
50% confluence and transfected with Fugene 6 (Roche, Man-
nheim, Germany). Around 48 hr post-transfection, the cells were
incubated with 100 nM Lysotracker (Molecular Probes, USA) in
growth medium for 3 hr in dark, at 37uC in a 10% CO2
incubator. The cells were then washed with PBS and fixed with
2% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. For
antibody staining, cells were permeabilized with 0.4% saponin for
15 min at room temperature, blocked with PBS containing 5%
bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 30 min and then incubated with
a 1:50 dilution of the primary antibody in PBS containing 5% BSA
for 1 hr at room temperature. The cells were washed thrice for
5 min each with PBS and then incubated with a 1:500 dilution of
the relevant Alexa 647 conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular
Probes, USA) in PBS containing 5% BSA for 1 hr. The coverslips
were mounted on slides with Antifade reagent (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
USA) and sealed with a synthetic rubber-based adhesive (Fevicol;
Pidilite Industries, India). Imaging and analysis was done on a
Nikon A1R confocal microscope. The Pearson coefficient for
colocalization was calculated using the Nikon Elements Software.
Flow Cytometry
Huh7 cells were transfected as above and 48 hr later the cells
were washed twice with PBS. Subsequently, 1.5 to1.86106 cells
were harvested in 1 mM EDTA in PBS for 1 min following by two
washings with PBS. The cells were fixed with 2% paraformalde-
hyde (PFA) for 20 min at 4uC, washed twice with PBS, then
resuspended in permeabilization buffer (PB; 0.1% Saponin and
1% fetal calf serum in PBS) for 10 min at 4uC followed by two
washings with PB. The cells were then incubated in PB containing
1:50 diluted rabbit anti-IFNAR1 for 30 min at 4uC. After washing
twice with PB, the cells were incubated with 1:100 diluted Alexa-
488 conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, USA) for
30 min in dark at 4uC. Lastly, the cells were washed thrice with PB
and kept in staining buffer (0.1% PFA, 1% FCS in PBS). For each
sample, 25,000 events were acquired using a CyAn-ADP flow
cytometer (Dako) and the data analyzed with Summit software
(version 4.3). The cells were gated for ECFP or 3a-ECFP
expression and Alexa-488 staining levels were determined in these
cells. Expression levels (6SD) of IFNAR1 were calculated and the
results were expressed as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values.
The p values were calculated using Student’s t-test with 95%
confidence intervals.
