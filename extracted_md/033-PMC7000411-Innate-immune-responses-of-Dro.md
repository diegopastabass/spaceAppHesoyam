Abstract
The spaceflight environment is relevant to conditions encountered by pathogens during the course of infection and induces
novel changes in microbial pathogenesis not observed using conventional methods. It is unclear how microbial cells sense
spaceflight-associated changes to their growth environment and orchestrate corresponding changes in molecular and
physiological phenotypes relevant to the infection process. Here we report that spaceflight-induced increases in Salmonella
virulence are regulated by media ion composition, and that phosphate ion is sufficient to alter related pathogenesis
responses in a spaceflight analogue model. Using whole genome microarray and proteomic analyses from two independent
Space Shuttle missions, we identified evolutionarily conserved molecular pathways in Salmonella that respond to
spaceflight under all media compositions tested. Identification of conserved regulatory paradigms opens new avenues to
control microbial responses during the infection process and holds promise to provide an improved understanding of
human health and disease on Earth.

Introduction
The environment of spaceflight offers insight into fundamental
cellular and molecular mechanisms directly relevant to human
health and infectious disease that cannot be observed using
traditional experimental approaches [1,2]. The recent discovery
that microbial pathogens cultured during spaceflight alter their
virulence profiles reveals the potential for identification of novel
classes of genes and proteins that are critical for the infection
process [2]. Although distinct bacterial responses have been
repeatedly observed during culture in spaceflight [1,2] the
mechanism(s) that initiates these responses is unclear. Historically,
studies of microbial responses in extreme environments such as
severe shifts in pH, osmotic concentration, or temperature, have
provided tremendous insight into our understanding of how
pathogens adapt and respond during the infection process in vivo
[3,4]. Many of these conditions reflect the environment that
pathogens encounter during the normal course of infection [4,5].
In this regard, the conditions that microorganisms experience in
the microgravity environment of spaceflight are relevant to low

fluid shear areas encountered by pathogens during infection of a
human host, such as between brush border microvilli in the
intestinal tract [6,7,8]. This latter environment holds particular
importance for enteric pathogens such as Salmonella.
In our early studies, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium
(hereafter referred to as S. typhimurium or Salmonella) was cultured in
a ground-based bioreactor that was used to model the low fluid
shear culture conditions that occur in microgravity as well as in
certain in vivo environments. This device, known as a rotating wall
vessel (RWV) bioreactor, produces an environment in which the
bacteria are exposed to low fluid shear during culture (Figure S1)
[1,9]. When S. typhimurium was cultured in this manner using
Lennox Broth (LB) media, the organism exhibited increased
virulence in a murine model of infection [9,10], increased
resistance to environmental stresses [9,10], and differentially
expressed 163 genes [11]. In particular, the Ferric Uptake
Regulator (Fur) protein was shown to play a role in low fluid
shear induced acid stress resistance [11]. Evaluation of microarray
data from Salmonella cultures grown in the RWV indicated that a
large number of genes encoding ion response pathways were
differentially regulated in response to low fluid shear growth
conditions [11]. In addition, the potential role for ion-mediated
regulation of cellular responses to this environment was also
observed in additional RWV bioreactor experiments, showing that
in M9 minimal media, Salmonella lag phase and generation time
were shortened compared to controls; an effect not observed in LB
media under identical growth conditions [10]. The influence of
media composition observed with bacteria grown in the RWV
bioreactor is not solely restricted to S. typhimurium. A comparison of
the gene expression profiles from Escherichia coli cultures grown in
the RWV revealed distinct differences in the genes that were
differentially expressed when cultured in either MOPS minimal
media or LB media [12].
These observations led to flight experiments with S. typhimurium
aboard Space Shuttle mission STS-115 (September 2006), which
demonstrated that cultures grown in rich LB media in spaceflight
displayed
significant
alterations
in
global
gene
expression,
increased virulence, and biofilm-like formation as compared to
ground controls [2]. A central role was identified for the
conserved, small regulatory RNA-binding protein Hfq in regulat-
ing key aspects of the spaceflight microgravity response [2]. In
addition, many genes encoding ion response pathways showed
altered expression during spaceflight, reinforcing our earlier results
observed in the spaceflight-analogue RWV bioreactor culture of S.
typhimurium. These results led us to hypothesize that media ion
concentrations could be manipulated to prevent the enhanced
Salmonella virulence imparted during spaceflight.
To test this hypothesis and further understand the mechanistic
effect of spaceflight on bacterial virulence, we performed analyses
on Salmonella cultured in varying media conditions aboard Space
Shuttle missions STS-115 and STS-123. In each case, the flight
culture samples were compared to culture samples grown under
identical conditions on the ground at Kennedy Space Center using
coordinated activation and termination times (via real time
communications with the Shuttle crew) in an insulated room that
maintained the identical temperature and humidity as that on the
Shuttle (Orbital Environment Simulator or OES). The culture
experiments were loaded into specially-designed hardware (termed
fluid
processing
apparatus
or FPA)
to
facilitate
controlled
activation and fixation of the cultures while maintaining suitable
culture containment requirements (Figure S3). These experiments
allowed the identification of a) media ion composition that
prevents spaceflight-induced increases in Salmonella virulence, and
b) commonalities and differences in Salmonella gene expression
between cultures of the same pathogen in different media during
spaceflight. As with spaceflight growth in LB, we show here that
Salmonella grown in M9 media during flight displayed differential
expression of many genes, including those associated with either
the regulation of, or regulation by, the Hfq protein and small
regulatory RNAs. Moreover, Salmonella grown in various media
demonstrated that ion concentrations had a direct effect on the
virulence of the spaceflight cultures. Specifically, we show that
media ion composition can be used to prevent the enhanced
Salmonella virulence imparted during spaceflight. Furthermore, we
show that higher concentrations of phosphate ions present in M9
medium during spaceflight analogue culture in the RWV altered
its pathogenic-related effects, thus providing the first evidence of a
mechanism behind this response. These findings indicate that
virulence in Salmonella can be influenced by the environmental
stimulus of spaceflight, and that the response to this stimulus can
be manipulated to improve astronaut health measures and
exploited to better understand microbial pathogenesis and develop
innovative therapeutics.
Results
Media and virulence in spaceflight–LB
Our previous flight experiment aboard STS-115 indicated that S.
typhimurium cultured during spaceflight exhibited increased virulence
in a murine model of infection [2]. Briefly, bacteria cultured in LB
during spaceflight and identical ground control cultures were
harvested and immediately used to inoculate female Balb/c mice via
a per-oral route of infection on the same day as Shuttle landing.
Mice were infected at increasing dosages of either flight or ground
cultures (10 mice per dose), and the health of the mice was
monitored every 6–12 hours for 30 days. Our previous results
showed that mice infected with S. typhimurium grown in LB media in
spaceflight aboard STS-115 displayed a decreased time-to-death
and a 2.7 fold decrease in LD50 value compared with those infected
with ground control cultures [2]. To confirm these findings, the
identical flight experiment was performed again aboard STS-123
(Figures S2 and S3). In agreement with the previous experiment,
mice infected with S. typhimurium grown in spaceflight aboard STS-
123 displayed a decreased time-to-death and a 6.9 fold decrease in
LD50 value compared with those infected with ground control
cultures (Figure 1, panels A, B, and C, LB medium).
Media and virulence in spaceflight–M9
Because of the strong association between nutrient composition
of the growth media and the extent of changes observed in S.
typhimurium responses in ground-based studies in the RWV, we
evaluated S. typhimurium virulence using cultures grown in M9
minimal media in separate experiments aboard Space Shuttle
missions STS-115 and STS-123. The procedures were otherwise
identical to those described for LB media growth [2]. Interestingly,
M9 cultures from both missions displayed dramatically different
virulence
characteristics
from
those
observed
for
Salmonella
cultured in LB (Figures 1A, 1B and 1C). Specifically, for infection
of mice with spaceflight and ground control Salmonella cultures
grown in M9 media, the time-to-death curves overlapped and did
not display the decrease in time-to-death as seen in the LB
spaceflight infections in both STS-115 and STS-123. Likewise, in
contrast with the decrease in LD50 values observed for the LB
flight cultures as compared to ground controls, M9 cultures of S.
typhimurium grown in spaceflight displayed no consistent difference
in LD50 from ground controls.

virulence characteristics of S. typhimurium grown during spaceflight,

an additional growth medium was used that consisted of LB media
supplemented with specific salts used in the preparation of M9
media. These specific salts were chosen because our quantitative
trace elemental analysis showed them to be at significantly
different levels in the two media. Specifically, the elemental
analysis indicated that the M9 medium had dramatically higher
concentrations of phosphate (61-fold higher than the LB media)
and magnesium (18-fold higher than the LB media). Other
significant differences in the M9 medium included higher levels of
sulfate (3.6-fold higher than the LB media), chloride (3-fold higher
than the LB media), and potassium (2.4-fold higher than the LB
media). Thus, for our follow-up flight experiment aboard STS-
123, we evaluated S. typhimurium virulence using cultures grown in
LB media supplemented with 25.18 mM NaH2PO4, 22 mM
KH2PO4, 18.68 mM NH4Cl, 8.54 mM NaCl, and 2 mM MgSO4
(designated as LB-M9 salts media), thereby bringing the levels of
these salts in LB media to the same as those in M9 media.
Interestingly, Salmonella cultured in LB-M9 salts media displayed
virulence characteristics similar to those observed when only the
M9 media was used (Figures 1A and 1C). Specifically, as seen with
cultures grown in only M9 media, mice infected with spaceflight
and ground cultures grown in LB-M9 salts media did not display
the decrease in time-to-death with spaceflight-grown cultures as
observed in the LB infections. Also in contrast to the LB media
cultures, cultures of S. typhimurium grown in LB-M9 salts media
during spaceflight did not display a decreased LD50 value
compared to ground controls using the same media (similar to
the results with M9 media).
Since nutrient composition could influence the virulence of S.
typhimurium [13], we compared the LD50 values for all media from
flight and all media from ground controls from the STS-123
mission to highlight the effect of spaceflight on virulence (Table 1).
A comparison of LD50 values from ground controls suggests that
indeed media plays a role in LD50 levels, with a 5.7 fold difference
between LB media and M9 media (with LB showing lower LD50
values). However, a comparison of LD50 values of cultures grown
during spaceflight shows a dramatic difference approximately 10
times greater than those observed in ground cultures, as shown
Figure 1. S. typhimurium virulence in LB, M9 and LB-M9 spaceflight cultures. A) Ratio of LD50 values of S. typhimurium spaceflight and
ground cultures grown in LB (Lennox Broth), M9, or LB-M9 salts media. Female Balb/c mice were perorally infected with a range of bacterial doses
from either spaceflight or ground cultures and monitored over a 30-day period for survival. B) Time-to-death curves of mice infected with spaceflight
and ground cultures from STS-115 (infectious dosage: 107 bacteria for both media). C) Time-to-death curves of mice infected with spaceflight and
ground cultures from STS-123 (infectious dosage: 106 bacteria for LB and 107 bacteria for M9 and LB-M9 salts). Infectious dosages were selected such
that the rates in time-to-death facilitated normalized comparisons across the different media.

with a 56.8 fold difference between LB media and M9 media. This
difference suggests that while media composition does affect LD50
values, the difference is exacerbated by the spaceflight environ-
ment.
Transcriptional and proteomic analysis
To determine which Salmonella genes changed expression in
response to spaceflight culture in M9 minimal media, total
bacterial RNA was isolated from fixed flight and ground samples,
qualitatively analyzed to ensure lack of degradation, quantified,
and then reversed transcribed into labeled, single-stranded cDNA.
The labeled cDNA was co-hybridized with differentially-labeled S.
typhimurium genomic DNA to whole genome S. typhimurium
microarray slides. Statistically-significant differences in gene
expression between the flight and ground M9 samples (above
1.8-fold increase and below 0.6-fold decrease in expression) were
obtained (see Materials and Methods for details). We found 38
genes differentially-expressed in flight M9 cultures as compared to
identical ground controls under these conditions (Table 2). Most
notably, several genes involved in motility (9 genes: flgA, flgC, flgF,
flgG, cheY, fliC, fliT, fliM, fljB), the formation of the Hyc
hydrogenase (4 genes: hydN, hycF, hycD, hyB), and the Suf
membrane transporter (3 genes: sufA, sufC, yhnA/sufE) were
identified as differentially expressed. In addition, several genes
encoding small regulatory RNA molecules (THI, csrB, rnpB, tke1)
were also identified.
The proteomes of fixed cultures from M9 flight and ground
samples
were
also
obtained
via
multi-dimensional
protein
identification (MudPIT) analysis. We identified 173 proteins
expressed in the flight and ground cultures, with 81 being present
at statistically different levels in these samples (Table S1) indicating
differential expression or stability. Notably, several proteins
involved in iron utilization and uptake (Fur, cytoplasmic ferritin,
Fe-S cluster formation, bactoferrin, siderophore receptor TonB,
iron transport protein, iron-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase,
and ferric enterobactin receptor) and ribosome structure (L7, L32,
S20, S13, S11 S19, L14, L33, S4, L4) were identified as
differentially expressed. Collectively, these transcriptional and
proteomic gene expression changes form the first documented
bacterial spaceflight stimulon in minimal growth media.
The LB and M9 spaceflight stimulons
We compared the S. typhimurium gene expression data from the
analysis above in M9 medium to the results from our previous
gene expression analysis in LB medium for spaceflight [2] and
RWV cultures [1]. Genes from each data set were cross-compared
to each other to identify common genes that were present as
differentially-expressed in both media. After this analysis, we found
that 15 genes (including adjacent genes) of the 38 identified as
transcriptionally altered in response to spaceflight in M9 medium
were also identified as differentially expressed in either spaceflight
or ground-based microgravity analogue RWV culture in LB
medium. This represents 39% (15/38) of the total genes found in
the M9 transcriptional analysis.
We subsequently extended this analysis to include genes that
also belong to the same directly-related functional or regulatory
gene group (i.e. not necessarily the same gene or operon, but genes
that function or are regulated as part of the same mechanism such
as motility), and discovered that the percentage of common genes
between analysis in M9 and LB media was 73% (28/38) (Table 2).
The functional groups of genes that we identified as regulated by
spaceflight or ground-based spaceflight analogue culture in both
M9 and LB media included those involved in flagellar-based
motility, Hyc hydrogenase formation, Suf transporter formation
and other ABC transporters, and small regulatory RNA molecules
(genes indicated in the section above). Additionally, there are also
eight ‘‘stand alone’’ genes that, to our knowledge, are not co-
regulated with these gene groups and include four genes encoding
putative, uncharacterized proteins (yaiA, trpD, yfiA, yhcB, grxB, acpP,
yfiD, STM4002). Several genes encoding proteins identified in the
spaceflight and ground proteomic analysis of M9 cultures were
also identified in the gene expression analysis of M9 and LB
cultures as well (Table S1).
Results from our previous studies indicated that 32% of the S.
typhimurium genes identified as differentially regulated in spaceflight
in LB medium belonged to a regulon of genes controlled by the
conserved RNA-binding protein Hfq [2]. We also demonstrated
that hfq was required for alterations in Salmonella acid resistance
and macrophage survival in response to the RWV ground-based
microgravity analogue model [2]. Therefore, we scanned the
results of our spaceflight M9 microarray and proteomic analysis
for members of a regulon of genes whose expression and activity is
regulated by or regulates Hfq, or whose protein products form a
functional regulatory complex with Hfq [14,15,16,17]. Consistent
with our previous observations in LB, we found four small non-
coding regulatory RNA genes (THI, csrB, rnpB, tke1) and three
mRNA transcripts (rpoS, sufE, fliC) regulated by Hfq in our
microarray analysis in M9 media (7 of 38 or 18%).
When we scanned the hits from our proteomic analysis for
relationships to the Hfq regulon, we found 28 of the 81 proteins
(34%) that were differentially expressed in response to spaceflight
in M9 media belonged to the Hfq regulon, or are part of a directly
related functional group of proteins that are regulated by Hfq.
Several observations led to the Hfq regulon members being

highlighted in our M9 proteomic analysis: 1) Hfq promotes the
expression of a large class of ribosomal structural proteins, and we
found differential expression of several of these genes in spaceflight
(L7/L12, L32, S20, S13, S11, S19, SA, L14, L33, S4, L4); 2) Hfq
regulates the expression of the Fur protein and other genes
involved in iron metabolism, and we found that Fur and other
iron-related genes are differentially regulated by spaceflight in M9
medium (Fur, Dps, NifU, FepA); 3) Several other proteins encoded
by genes belonging to the Hfq regulon were also found in this
analysis: NmpC, Tpx, PtsI, PtsH, SucC, LeuB, CysP, DppA,
OppA, RpoZ, CsrA, RpoB, NlpB. This data, taken together with
the microarray data, indicates the commonalities of the spaceflight

response in Salmonella in both LB and M9 media, and represents
the first common genes that have been identified to be regulated
by spaceflight and/or ground based spaceflight analogue culture in
both rich and minimal media.
Real time PCR analysis
To further confirm the commonalities we observed in global
gene expression analysis in response to spaceflight in both LB and
M9 media, we performed targeted quantitative real time PCR
assays using cDNA synthesized from total RNA harvested from
spaceflight and ground cultures in LB and M9 media as templates
(Figure 2). The csrB, yfiD, rnpB genes (down-regulated), and the
trpD gene (up-regulated) were found to be differentially-regulated
in response to spaceflight as compared to ground cultures in both
LB and M9 media using global transcriptional analysis. These
results were also found using real time PCR (Figure 2) and confirm
data from our global analysis.
Role of phosphate ion
We previously demonstrated that Salmonella consistently and
reproducibly alters its acid tolerance response when grown in the
RWV using LB medium [9]. To support findings from spaceflight
that the supplementation of LB media with selected M9 salts
disrupts S. typhimurium responses to this envir onment, cultures
containing LB media, M9 media, and LB-M9 salts media were
grown in the RWV at low shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG/
spaceflight analogue culture conditions) and control orientations
(Figure S1) and evaluated for changes in acid tolerance. As
demonstrated previously, cultures of S. typhimurium grown in LB
media in the RWV (LSMMG) displayed altered acid resistance as
compared to control cultures. However, no difference in acid
tolerance was observed with cultures grown in M9 media or in LB-
M9 salts media (Figure 3). We then used LB media supplemented
with different combinations of M9 salts to determine which of
these ions was responsible for disruption of the acid tolerance
response observed in LB medium (Figure 3). Our results indicate
that the presence of phosphate from two different sources
(NaH2PO4 and KH2PO4) is sufficient to disrupt the altered acid
tolerance in response to LSMMG. Although hydrogen ions are
present in each of these compounds, we found no correlation
between the pH of the different media before or after culture and
the observed phenotypes. Likewise, this finding indicates that the
buffering capacity of phosphate is not responsible for this
phenotype and that the presence of the phosphate ion itself is
responsible for the acid tolerance alteration. In addition, increased
osmolarity of the media is not the cause of this phenotype, since
raising the level of NaCl to 25 mM (the same level as Na2HPO4
and KH2PO4) did not show the same phenotype as the presence of
the phosphate-containing compounds (Figure 3).
Discussion
Results from our initial spaceflight study raised compelling
questions regarding the effect of spaceflight on microbial virulence
and gene expression [2]. However, given the significant techno-
logical and logistical constraints associated with spaceflight
experiments, acquiring biological replicates and testing new
hypotheses is extraordinarily difficult. Independent experiments
conducted on two separate Space Shuttle missions allowed us to
establish that spaceflight increases S. typhimurium virulence in LB
medium. This finding indicates that the effects of spaceflight on S.
typhimurium are not due to DNA mutations caused by ionizing
radiation, since random genomic mutations induced by radiation
would not likely be reproduced in multiple experiments. These
multiple spaceflight opportunities allowed us to test the hypothesis
that changes in ion levels in growth media can serve to disrupt the
unique
environmental
signals
of
spaceflight
sensed
by
S.
typhimurium cultures, thereby leading to alterations in microbial
virulence. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that the
increased S. typhimurium virulence observed with cultures grown in
spaceflight in LB medium, as compared to identical ground
controls, is not exhibited with cultures grown in M9 medium.
Based upon our quantified differences in ion concentrations
between LB and M9 media, we supplemented LB medium with
inorganic ions to the same levels as those found in M9 medium.
We found that this ion supplementation was sufficient to prevent
the enhanced Salmonella virulence imparted during flight. Subse-
quent
testing
in ground-based
spaceflight
analogue
culture
conditions indicted that the altered acid tolerance exhibited by
Salmonella during culture in LB alone was prevented with the
addition of inorganic phosphate. These results demonstrate a
direct correlation between phosphate ion concentration and the
phenotypic response of Salmonella to the environment of spaceflight
analogue culture.
Figure 2. qRT-PCR analysis confirms S. typhimurium gene expression altered during spaceflight in LB and M9 media. Total RNA
harvested from spaceflight and ground cultures in the indicated media was converted to single-stranded cDNA and used as a template in qRT-PCR
analysis with primers hybridizing to the indicated genes. PCR product levels were normalized to the 16S rRNA product and a ratio of each gene level
in flight and ground cultures was calculated. All differences in expression between spaceflight and ground cultures were found to be statistically
significant using student’s t-test (p-value,0.05). The error bars represent the standard deviation for three to nine independent technical replicate
experiments.

The correlation of this finding to the actual in vivo infection
process on Earth is unclear, but there are reports in the published
literature that suggest possible clues. Previous studies indicate a
relationship between the regulation of phosphate levels in vivo and
intestinal
function,
including
in
response
to
infection
[18,19,20,21,22,23]. This relationship could be associated, in
part, with the enzyme alkaline phosphatase, which is prevalent in
the small intestine and is found on the apical brush border surface.
It is known that infection by intestinal pathogens (including
Salmonella) or their components can significantly alter levels of
alkaline phosphatase in the intestine [20,21,22,23]. Moreover, the
low fluid shear conditions found near the brush border of the
intestine may be similar to the low fluid shear environment of
microgravity during spaceflight and could potentially initiate
similar Salmonella response profiles to those observed in our study
[8]. It is also interesting to note that Salmonella uses the phosphatase
activity of the bacterial enzyme SopB to promote its growth and
survival inside intestinal epithelial cells [19]. Taken together, this
information suggests a potential relationship between phosphate
levels, a low fluid shear environment, and the Salmonella enteric
infection process in vivo, although the specific mechanism(s) is not
known.
We also compared the spaceflight-induced molecular genetic
responses of S. typhimurium cultured in different growth media (LB
[2] versus M9 [this work]) using whole genome transcriptional and
proteomic analyses. Despite the multiple phenotypic differences in
response to spaceflight between the two media, we found that
several common genes and gene families were altered in
expression in both media during spaceflight culture. Identification
of these genes, whose expression is commonly regulated by the low
fluid shear environment of spaceflight, provides key targets whose
expression can be manipulated to control microbial responses,
including potential use for development of vaccines and thera-
peutics. As identified in this study, these targets include gene
systems involved in flagellar-based motility, Hyc hydrogenase
formation, Suf transporter formation and other ABC transporters,
ribosomal structure, iron utilization, and small regulatory RNA
molecule expression and function. Many of the genes that were
found differentially expressed during spaceflight culture of S.
typhimurium in M9 media in this work were also consistent with
those reported in LB culture for this same organism under
identical conditions [2]. In both cases, many of these genes are
found in regulons that are controlled by or regulate the activity of
the Hfq protein. Interestingly, Hfq activity has previously been
associated with phosphate regulation [24,25]. Our findings further
highlight Hfq as a global regulator to target for further study to
understand the mechanism used by Salmonella to respond to
spaceflight, spaceflight analogue systems, and other physiological
low fluid shear environments.
In conclusion, results from these studies support a model in
which modulation of different ion concentrations controls the
spaceflight-associated
virulence
response
of
microorganisms.
Moreover, since the low fluid shear environment of spaceflight
and spaceflight analogue culture systems is relevant to that
encountered by pathogens during the infection process in vivo, the
identity of commonly conserved molecular targets offers insight for
new treatment and prevention strategies. Potential applications of
this finding hold exciting promise for mitigating risk to crew health
during spaceflight and can be exploited to develop new strategies
to combat infectious disease on Earth.
Materials and Methods
Strains, media, and chemical reagents
The virulent, mouse-passaged Salmonella typhimurium derivative of
SL1344, termed x3339, was used in all flight and ground-based
experiments [26]. Lennox broth (LB) (10 g tryptone, 5 g yeast
extract, 5 g NaCl) [27], M9 medium (0.4% glucose) [10], or LB -
M9 salts medium were used as the growth media in all
experiments and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (Invitrogen,
Figure 3. Increased phosphate ion concentration prevents altered S. typhimurium acid tolerance in ground-based spaceflight analog
culture. Cultures of S. typhimurium grown in the indicated medium in the rotating wall vessel in the low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) or
control orientation were subjected to acid stress (pH 3.5) immediately upon removal from the apparatus. A ratio of percent survival of the bacteria
cultured at each orientation in each media is presented. The error bars represent the standard deviation for two to five independent experimental
trials each plated in triplicate. All differences in survival ratios were found to be statistically significant at p-value,0.05.

Carlsbad, CA) was used to resuspend bacteria for use as inoculum
in the flight hardware. The LB-M9 salts medium consisted of LB
medium supplemented with the following amounts of ions:
8.54 mM
NaCl,
25.18 mM
NaH2PO4,
18.68 mM
NH4Cl,
22 mM KH2PO4, and 2 mM MgSO4. The RNA fixative RNA
Later II (Ambion, Austin, TX), was used to preserve nucleic acid
and protein in flight experiments.
Spaceflight culture
Spaceflight
and ground control cultures
were grown in
specialized hardware termed fluid processing apparatus (FPA) as
described previously [2] (Figures S2 and S3). Briefly, an FPA
consists of a glass barrel that can be divided into compartments via
the insertion of rubber stoppers and a lexan sheath into which the
glass barrel is inserted. Each compartment in the glass barrel was
filled with a solution in an order such that the solutions would be
mixed at specific time points in flight via two actions: (1)
downward plunging action on the rubber stoppers and (2) passage
of the fluid in a given compartment through a bevel on the side of
the glass barrel such that it was released into the compartment
below. Glass barrels and rubber stoppers were coated with a
silicone
lubricant (Sigmacote,
Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and
autoclaved separately before assembly. A stopper with a gas
exchange membrane was inserted just below the bevel in the glass
barrel before autoclaving. FPA assembly was performed aseptically
in a laminar flow hood in the following order: 2.0 ml media (either
LB, M9 or LB-M9) on top of the gas exchange stopper, one rubber
stopper, 0.5 ml PBS containing bacterial inoculum (approximately
6.76106 bacteria), another rubber stopper, 2.5 ml of either RNA
fixative (for gene expression analysis) or media (either LB, M9 or
LB-M9 for virulence studies), and a final rubber stopper. Syringe
needles (gauge 25 5/8) were inserted into rubber stoppers during
this process to release air pressure and facilitate assembly. To
facilitate group activation of FPAs during flight and to ensure
proper containment levels, sets of 8 FPAs were loaded into larger
containers termed group activation packs (GAPs). After activation,
cultures were grown for 25 hours in either spaceflight or ground
until either fixation or media supplementation. Upon landing,
cultures were received for processing approximately 2.5 hours
after Shuttle touchdown.
Microarray analysis
Total cellular RNA purification from cultures grown in M9
media, preparation of fluorescently-labeled, single stranded cDNA
probes, probe hybridization to whole genome S. typhimurium
microarrays, and image acquisition was performed as previously
described [2,11] using three biological and three technical
replicates for each culture condition. Direct microscopic cell
counting and spectrophotometric readings indicated that cell
numbers in flight and ground biological replicate cultures differed
by less than 2-fold (data not shown). Data analysis was performed
using software as described previously [2]. To obtain the genes
comprising the spaceflight stimulon in M9 media, the following
parameters were used in Webarray software [28]: an expression
ratio of flight to ground of 1.8 fold or greater or 0.6 or less; a spot
quality (A-value) of greater than 9.5, and p-value of less than 0.05.
To identify spaceflight stimulon genes also contained in the Hfq
regulon, proteins or genes found to be regulated by Hfq or RNAs
found to be bound by Hfq as reported in the indicated references
were
scanned
against
the
spaceflight
microarray
data
for
expression changes within the parameters above [14,15,16,17].
The microarray data reported in this paper have been deposited in
the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/geo (accession no. GSE8573).
Multidimensional protein identification (MudPIT) analysis
via tandem mass spectrometry coupled to dual nano-
liquid chromatography (LC-LC-MS/MS)
Acetone-protein precipitates from whole cell lysates obtained
from flight and ground cultures grown in M9 media (representing
three biological replicates) were subjected to MudPIT analysis
using the LC-LC-MS/MS technique (three technical replicates) as
described previously [2,29,30]. Tandem MS spectra of peptides
were analyzed with TurboSEQUESTTM v 3.1 and XTandem
software, and the data were further analyzed and organized using
the Scaffold program [2,29,30]. Please refer to Table S1 for the
specific parameters used in Scaffold to identify the proteins in this
study.
Quantitative Real time PCR (qRT-PCR)
qRT-PCR analysis was performed with primers hybridizing to
the indicated genes as described previously using the 16S rRNA
gene to normalize samples [31]. Data from three to nine separate
technical replicate reactions was used for each gene in Figure 2,
and the differences in expression were found to be statistically
significant using student’s t-test (p-value,0.05). The sequences of
the primers used here are given in Figure S4.
Murine infection assay
Six to eight week old female Balb/c mice (housed in the Animal
Facility at the Space Life Sciences Lab at Kennedy Space Center)
were deprived of food and water for approximately 6 hours and
then perorally infected with increasing dosages of S. typhimurium
harvested from either flight or ground FPA cultures and
resuspended in buffered saline gelatin [2]. Infectious dosages
increasing ten-fold in a range between approximately 16104 and
16109 bacteria (thus comprising six infectious dosages per
bacterial culture) were used in the infections. Ten mice per
infectious dosage were used, 20 ml per dose, and food and water
were returned to the animals within 30 minutes post-infection.
The infected mice were monitored every 6–12 hours for 30 days.
The LD50 value was calculated using the formula of Reed and
Muench [32].
Trace element analysis using Inductively Coupled Plasma
(ICP) spectrometry and Ion Chromatography (IC)
Determination of inorganic ion levels in LB and M9 media was
performed using ICP spectrometry and IC as described previously
[33].
Ground based RWV cultures and acid stress assays
S. typhimurium cultures were grown in rotating wall vessels for
24 hours at 37 degrees C in the LSMMG and control orientations
in LB, M9 or LB media supplemented with the indicated ions from
M9 salts (LB-M9 salts media) and assayed for resistance to pH 3.5
as described previously [2,9]. The percentage of surviving bacteria
present after 45–60 minutes acid stress (compared to the original
number of bacteria before addition of the stress) was calculated via
serial dilution and CFU plating. A ratio of the percent survival
values for the LSMMG and control cultures in all three growth
media was obtained (indicating the fold difference in survival
between these cultures) and is presented as the acid survival ratio
in Figure 3. The mean and standard deviation from between two
and five independent experimental trials per culture is presented
with observed differences in survival ratios being statistically-
significant at p-value,0.05.

Figure S1
The rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor and power
supply. Panel A: The cylindrical culture vessel is completely filled
with culture medium through ports on the face of the vessel and
operates by rotating around a central axis. Cultures are aerated
through a hydrophilic membrane that covers the back of the
cylinder. The power supply is shown below the bioreactor. Panel
B: The two operating orientations of the RWV are depicted. In the
LSMMG orientation (panel i), the axis of rotation of the RWV is
perpendicular to the direction of the gravity force vector. In the
control orientation (panel ii), the axis of rotation is parallel with the
gravity vector. Panel C: The effect of RWV rotation on particle
suspension is depicted. When the RWV is not rotating, or rotating
in the control orientation (panel i), the force of gravity will cause
particles in apparatus to sediment and eventually settle on the
bottom of the RWV. When the RWV is rotating in the LSMMG
position (panel ii), particles are continually suspended in the
media. The media within the RWV rotates as a single body, and
the sedimentation of the particle due to gravity is offset by the
upward forces of rotation. The result is low shear aqueous
suspension that is strikingly similar to what would occur in true
microgravity.

ments. Panel A: Schematic diagram of an FPA. An FPA consists of
a glass barrel that contains a short bevel on one side and stoppers
inside that separate individual chambers containing fluids used in
the experiment. The glass barrel loaded with stoppers and fluids is
housed inside a lexan sheath containing a plunger that pushes on
the top stopper to facilitate mixing of fluids at the bevel. The
bottom stopper in the glass barrel (and also the bottom of the lexan
sheath) is designed to contain a gas-permeable membrane that
allows air exchange during bacterial growth. In the STS-115 and
STS-123 experiments, the bottom chamber contained media, the
middle chamber contained the bacterial inoculum suspended in
PBS, and the top chamber contained either RNA/protein fixative
or additional media. Upon activation, the plunger was pushed
down so that only the middle chamber fluid was mixed with the
bottom chamber to allow media inoculation and bacterial growth.
At this step, the plunger was pushed until the bottom of the middle
rubber stopper was at the top part of the bevel. After the 25-hour
growth period, the plunger was pushed until the bottom of the top
rubber stopper was at the top part of the bevel such that the top
chamber fluid was added. Panel B: Photograph of FPAs in pre-
flight configuration. Panel C: Photograph of FPAs in post-flight
configuration showing that all stoppers have been pushed together
and the entire fluid sample is in the bottom chamber.
