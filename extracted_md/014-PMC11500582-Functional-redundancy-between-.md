Abstract
Cell adhesion in plants is mediated predominantly by pectins, a group of complex cell wall associated polysaccharides. An
Arabidopsis mutant, friable1 (frb1), was identified through a screen of T-DNA insertion lines that exhibited defective cell
adhesion. Interestingly, the frb1 plants displayed both cell and organ dissociations and also ectopic defects in organ
separation. The FRB1 gene encodes a Golgi-localized, plant specific protein with only weak sequence similarities to known
proteins (DUF246). Unlike other cell adhesion deficient mutants, frb1 mutants do not have reduced levels of adhesion
related cell wall polymers, such as pectins. Instead, FRB1 affects the abundance of galactose- and arabinose-containing
oligosaccharides in the Golgi. Furthermore, frb1 mutants displayed alteration in pectin methylesterification, cell wall
associated extensins and xyloglucan microstructure. We propose that abnormal FRB1 action has pleiotropic consequences
on wall architecture, affecting both the extensin and pectin matrices, with consequent changes to the biomechanical
properties of the wall and middle lamella, thereby influencing cell-cell adhesion.

Introduction
The middle lamella, which is formed during cell division, allows
for cell-cell adhesion between plant cells. The principle component
of the middle lamella is pectic polysaccharides (pectins; [1]).
Pectins
comprise
three
principle
classes:
variably
esterified
homopolymers of galacturonic acid (homogalacturonan; HG);
polymers of alternating rhamnose and galacturonic acid residues
that are substituted with arabinan and galactan sidechains,
rhamnogalacturonan I (RGI), and rhamnogalacturonan II (RGII);
a structural pectin consisting of a galacturonic acid backbone with
complex saccharide side chains [2]. These polymers are present in
differing ratios in both the primary cell wall, where they form a
complex assemblage with the other major polysaccharides, such as
cellulose and hemicelluloses, and in and middle lamella [3].
The most abundant pectic polysaccharides in the middle lamella
are HGs with a low degree of methylesterification; a characteristic
that may promote cell adhesion since pectin demethylation can
enhance calcium cross-linking of adjacent HG chains and
consequent gel formation [4–8]. HG-mediated cell adhesion is
thought to require the action of apoplastic pectin methylesterases
(PMEs) since HGs are often secreted in a highly esterified form [2].
The middle lamella also contains structural cell wall proteins,
such as hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins [9,10], glycine-rich
proteins [11] and arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs). The latter may
be implicated in cell adhesion because of the apparent binding to
pectins [1,12–14]. Other possible modes of cell adhesion include
cross-linking of polymers in middle lamella with components of the
primary cell wall. For example, it is evident that some pectins are
linked to xyloglucans (XyG) [15,16], which in turn associate with
cellulose microfibrils. Indeed, recent reports suggest that XyGs are
involved in cell adhesion [17].
Several mutations that lead to reduced cell adhesion affect
pectin-related functions [18–20]. For example, quasimodo1 (qua1)
shows a reduction in cell adhesion attributed to defective HG
synthesis [18,21]. A recombinant QUA1-related protein, GAUT1,
can transfer GalA residues onto HG oligomers [22], further
indicating that QUA1 plays a role in HG synthesis. Plants carrying
mutations at the QUA2/TSD2 locus also show reductions in both
cell adhesion [19,23], and HG content [19]. The corresponding
gene encodes a Golgi-localized membrane protein that contains a
predicted methyltransferase domain [19,23]. This suggests that
HG synthesis and cell adhesion require both polymerase and
methyltransferase activities [19]. Other genes that have been
implicated in pectin synthesis by virtue of their cell adhesion
defects, and their homology to glycosyltransferases, are EPC1 [20]
and, in tobacco, NpGUT1 [24]. The latter encodes a putative
glycosyltransferase that was thought to be involved in RGII
synthesis [24]. However, this contention has recently been
disputed following the characterization of loss-of-function muta-
tions in two closely related genes, IRX10 and IRX10-L genes
[25,26] that are deficient in xylan.
Another type of cell adhesion deficiency is perturbed cell
separation, or organ fusion, which can happen as a consequence of

defective cuticular wax formation (for review see [27,28]). One
explanation for the ectopic fusions is that the cuticle normally
blocks cell wall interactions between adjacent organs, which
prevent ectopic adhesion. However, the variation in developmen-
tal phenotypes among wax mutants suggests that other unknown
mechanisms also are involved in establishing these fusions [28].
Here, we report the identification and characterization of an
Arabidopsis gene, FRIABLE1 (FRB1), which affects both cell
adhesion and organ fusion. FRB1 encodes a Golgi localized, plant
specific, membrane protein with weak similarity to known
proteins, and appears to be required for cell wall integrity.
Results
frb1 seedlings display both cell dissociation and adhesion
phenotypes
To identify Arabidopsis mutants with cell adhesion defects we
conducted a visual screen on approximately 10,000 seedlings from
a segregating T2 population transformed with a pCAMBIA1300
derivative (CAMBIA, Black Mountain, Australia). Although a
number of seedlings with aberrant morphologies were identified,
one mutant had an obvious fused cotyledon phenotype which we
could easily identify using a dissecting microscope. We later
confirmed that this was a recessively segregating mutant, which we
named friable1 (frb1). The frb1 seedlings displayed three interrelated
phenotypes: cell dissociation, spontaneous breakage, and ectopic
organ fusion (Figure 1). The cell dissociation phenotype involved
the sloughing of cells in seedlings to the point where tissues
appeared to crumble, or were ‘‘friable’’ (Figures 1C and D). In
other cases (10% of the time), dissociation of entire plant parts
occurred, leading to spontaneous organ breakage (Figure 1B).
Seedlings that showed severe cell dissociation typically died. Cell
dissociation defects were not apparent in roots or in adult plants
(data not shown). Paradoxically, frb1 plants also displayed a
defective ectopic organ fusion phenotype. In many instances (40%
of the time), seedlings with fused cotyledons (Figure 1C), or fused
hypocotyls and cotyledons (Figures 1F and G), were observed.
These contrasting phenotypes suggest that FRB1 is required for
cell adhesion in seedling tissues.
Loss of FRB1 function affects embryo development and
leads to abundant surface homogalacturonan in
seedlings
The defects in cell adhesion were also observed in frb1 embryos
(Figures 2A to F), which displayed distorted morphology where
cotyledons did not expand fully and, instead of flattened discs as in
wild-type, were cup-shaped (Figures 2A to D). There were no
apparent differences in tissue organization in frb1 compared to
FRB1, although cells in frb1 were more variable in size and shape
as a result of uneven cell files (Figures 2E and F). These
phenotypes might be due to poor cell adherence allowing cells
to slide past one another during embryo development.
Using scanning electron microscopy we observed a substance
exuding from frb1 cotyledon cells (Figure 3). To determine if this
substance consisted of pectic polymers, we used the antibodies
JIM5 and JIM7 to assess the presence of HG epitopes using whole
seedlings without chemical fixation to limit antibody access to cell
surfaces. While the surfaces of wild-type cotyledons were sparsely
decorated by JIM5 (Figure 3C), those of frb1 were uniformly
decorated (Figures 3D to F). Separated cells displayed long JIM5
cross-reactive strands connecting the cells (Figures 3E and F).
Similarly, JIM7 epitopes were also more extensively stained in frb1
plants (Figures 3G and H). This indicates that at least a portion of
the surface substance is HG.
Cloning and characterization of FRB1
To determine the location of the T-DNA insertion in frb1–1 we
conducted TAIL-PCR (Liu et al. 1995). The T-DNA insertion in
frb1–1 was located to the upstream region of At5g01100 (Figure
S1A). We confirmed that this locus corresponded to the frb1
mutant phenotype by analyzing two additional T-DNA insertion
mutants (SALK_078459; frb1–2, and WiscDsLox1D5; frb1–3) that
have inserts at the FRB1 gene locus. We further confirmed that
these alleles held reduced FRB1 transcript by RT-PCR as no
transcript was detected after 30 PCR cycles (Figure S1B).
However, when we increased the number of PCR cycles to 40,
we detected a faint band in frb1–1 (Figure S1B), suggesting that
while frb1–2 and frb1–3 are most likely mRNA nulls, frb1–1 is only
a partial loss-of-function. This result is consistent with the location
of the T-DNA insertion in frb1–1 (in the predicted promoter
region).
The FRB1 gene is predicted to encode a 631-amino acid
protein (71.3 kD) with a putative N-terminal transmembrane
domain (TMHMM Server v. 2.0; CBS, Denmark), and to be a
type II transmembrane protein. It has a conserved plant-specific
domain of unknown function (DUF246) spanning about 300
amino acids in the C-terminal region (Figure S1C). The protein
does not contain any other unambiguous motifs that would
suggest a possible function. In Arabidopsis at least 34 predicted
proteins occur with significant homology to FRB1 (Figure S2).
The conserved DUF246 domain is found in at least 210 proteins
in different plant species (InterPro number: IPR004348), includ-
ing 71 in Arabidopsis.
Expression of FRB1
To examine FRB1 gene expression we generated transgenic
plants containing a b-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene under
control of the complete intergenic region (4.3 kbp) between the
ATG start codon for FRB1, and the stop codon for the
upstream gene. GUS activity was weak in germinating seeds
(Figure
S3A),
but
became
stronger
during
early
seedling
development (Figures 4A and B; S3B to E), particularly at
the
junction
between
hypocotyl
and
root,
in
emerging
cotyledons, and in parts of the roots in 2-day-old seedlings
(Figures 4A and S3B). The FRB1 promoter was less active in
older seedlings (Figure 4C). The strong activity of the FRB1
promoter in young seedlings is consistent with the observed
mutant phenotypes. However, the FRB1 promoter was also
active in the inflorescence (sepals, petals, mature pollen, and
siliques) and rosette leaves (Figures 4E to H).
FRB1 is localized to the Golgi apparatus
To investigate the sub-cellular localization of FRB1 we
generated an N-terminal translational fusion of GFP (green
fluorescent protein) to FRB1 (GFP-FRB1), which complemented
the frb1 mutant phenotypes (Figure S4). The GFP signal in
transgenic GFP-FRB1 Arabidopsis plants was present in small,
highly motile (Movie S1), compartments in the cortical cyto-
plasm, which traveled within cytoplasmic strands, similar to
previously reported Golgi-localized proteins ([29] Figures 5A to
C). The compartments were affected by inhibitors that target
Golgi dynamics [29,30], such as the actin inhibitor Latrunculin B
(1 mM; 15 min of treatment; Movie S2), and the protein transport
inhibitor Brefeldin A (BFA) (Movie S3), which inhibits protein
trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi
apparatus ([31]; Figure 5D). Treatment of GFP-FRB1 with BFA
resulted
in
concentration
of
large
perinuclear
aggregates,
consistent with previously identified ‘‘Brefeldin A compartments’’
[30,32]. Furthermore, transient co-expression of GFP-FRB1 and

a Golgi-marker 9(CD3–967) [33] in tobacco cells revealed
overlapping localization (Figures 5E to G). In addition, western
blots of the Golgi-tagged FRB1 protein indicates that it is
localized to a membrane fraction (Figure S5). These results
indicate that FRB1 is likely localized to a compartment similar to
the Golgi apparatus.
frb1 mutants display complex cell wall alterations
To determine whether the frb1 phenotypes are associated with
changes in cell wall composition, we first assessed whether the
observed differences in antibody staining of whole frb1 seedlings
were a result of increased accessibility or abundance of HG
polymers. We therefore measured the release of uronic acids from
frb1 mutants using different extraction methods (Figure 6A;
Table 1). We first treated ten day-old seedlings gently with
ammonium oxalate, which extracts a limited portion of cell wall
pectins [34,35]. This treatment solubilized a higher proportion of
uronic acids from frb1 seedlings than from FRB1 (Figure 6A), but
this difference was no longer apparent when the remaining uronic
acids were extracted using hot acid (Figures 6A and B). This
suggests that certain uronic acids were more accessible or
differentially modified in frb1.To establish whether frb1 also has

altered cell wall sugar composition, we measured the monosac-
charides in the frb1 mutants (Figure 6B). This revealed that the
arabinose content was 50–80% (5–7 mg/mg cell wall) higher in
frb1 as compared to wild-type (Figure 6B). However, no changes
were observed in the absolute uronic acid content (Figures 6A and
B; Table 1). Arabinose is a major component of pectin side chains
and of the glycosyl moieties of arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs)
and extensins. To investigate whether the changed arabinose
content is associated with a specific polymer type we fractionated
cell wall material to enrich for certain matrix polymers. Neutral
sugar analysis of the sequential extracts revealed that the increase
of arabinose is consistent among all fractions (20–30 % in the
CDTA and Na2CO3 fractions, and 40–80% in the 4 M KOH and
the insoluble fractions; Table 1). We reasoned that the increased
arabinose levels associated with the pectic fractions may signify
higher levels of RGI-holding arabinan portions. To test this we
used the LM6 monoclonal antibody, which binds a-(1–5)-L-
arabinans [36,37], which is predominately found in RGI side
chains, but LM6 may also bind to some AGPs (http://www.
plantprobes.net).
We
also
tested
whether
we
could
detect
differential binding of LM1 antibody, which binds preferentially
to the glycan component of extensins [9]. We observed slightly
increased LM1 labeling, particularly in the cortical region of
mutant hypocotyls, but LM6 patterning in frb1 sections was
indistinguishable from that seen in FRB1 (Figures 7D to K).
Although no major changes were detected in galactose from the
crude cell wall analysis, we observed differences in fractionated cell
wall material (Table 1). Interestingly, galactose abundance was
lower (7%) in the pectic CDTA fraction, but greater (approxi-
mately 15% to 40%) in the 4 M KOH and insoluble fractions,
respectively (Table 1). These data suggest that either the
incorporation of galactose and arabinose into certain polymers is
abnormal in the mutants or that structural alterations promote
extractability.
frb1 alters the galactose and arabinose ratio
To test whether the observed cell wall alterations originated from
either biosynthetic, i.e Golgi-localized, or cell wall modifying
reactions, i.e. apoplastic, we conducted a sugar analysis of

microsomal membranes. This experiment revealed that the
increased arabinosyl- and decreased galactosyl residues are already
apparent in membrane compartments (Figure 8A; Table 2), and are
thus likely due to enzyme activities in a membranous compartment.
This is consistent with the membrane localization of the FRB1
protein, and could indicate that the efficiency of galactose and
arabinose incorporation is altered due to FRB1 deficiency. In this
case, we would expect to see lower incorporation of galactose in frb1
membrane-enriched fractions. To test this we performed incorpo-
ration assays using membrane preparations from the frb1 mutants
and wild-type. Interestingly, the frb1-derivedmembranes incorporat-
ed as much, or more, UDP-galactose as the wild-type fractions
(Figures 8B and C), which was evident in both the protein and lipid
fraction of the membranes (Figures 8B and C). These data indicate
that frb1 plants can utilize UDP-galactose but they incorporate less
into galactose-harboring polymers such as XyGs, RGIs or
glycoproteins.
Since FRB1 appears to be a Type II membrane protein, it could
represent a glycosyltransferase. To test this we expressed FRB1 in
insect cells and assayed it for activity using a range of substrates
and targets (Table S1). None of the combinations tested resulted in
incorporation of substrates (data not shown). While this does not
exclude that FRB1 is a glycosyltransferase, the target substrate has
yet to be identified.
frb1 has modified xyloglucan structures
The increase in galactose associated with the 4 M KOH fraction
may signify an alteration in the hemicellulosic polymer XyG. The
fine structure of XyG was therefore determined using oligosaccharide
mass profiling (OLIMP) [38,80]. This revealed increased abundance
of galactose-containing XyG subunits (All L, Figures 9D to F) in the
XyG-enriched 4 M KOH extract of frb1. Similarly, the relative
amounts of galactosylated (All L), fucosylated (All F) and O-acetylated
(All Ac) XyG oligosaccharides were all elevated in crude cell walls of

frb1 (Figures 9A to C). This was mainly due to a relative increase of
one particular fucose- and galactose-containing oligosaccharide
(XXFG+Ac). Neutral sugar analyses (Table 1) showed a net-
reduction of galactose in the CDTA fraction, and a net-increase in
the 4 M KOH fraction. Although OLIMP is not a quantitative
method together with the fractionated sugar analysis the results
suggest that there is a net-increase of galactosylation in XyG
(Figures 9A to C) and a net-decrease of galactose-containing polymers
in the CDTA fraction most likely originating from RGI or perhaps
glycosylated cell wall proteins.
Loss of FRB1 function leads to an up-regulation of genes
relevant for cell wall integrity and desiccation protection
responses
To gain more insight into processes that are affected by the frb1
mutation we performed transcript profiling using RNA isolated
from 10-day-old frb1–1 and FRB1 seedlings, and probed ATH1
microarrays in triplicates. The complete list of genes with altered
expression levels in frb1 compared to wild type is shown in Table
S2. In total, 114 genes had an average fold-change of at least two
in the frb1–1 background. Eighty-seven of these were up-regulated,
and 27 genes down-regulated. Many of the up-regulated genes are

annotated as storage proteins (Table S4), which often are
associated with late seed development, and desiccation tolerance
[39]. Such genes are perhaps up-regulated to mitigate increased
water loss that may occur due to disrupted tissue integrity in frb1–1
seedlings [40,41].
Interestingly, five cell wall-related genes, which may be related
to cell adhesion/dissociation, were up-regulated (Figure 7A). In
addition, all of these genes, namely a pectin-methylesterase (PME,
At4g02330), the hydroxyproline-rich glycoprotein EXTENSIN4
(EXT4, At1g76930), two XyG endo-transglucosylases/hydrolyases
XTH19 (At4g30290) and XTH23 (At4g25810), as well as COBRA
(At5g60920), encode presumed apoplastic structural or cell wall
modifying proteins (Figure 7A). While up-regulation of XTH19
and XTH23 (previously termed XTR6) may be associated to
differences in frb1 XyG structure, we find it unlikely that these
enzymes would impact on cell adhesion. Modifications in
expression of cellulose-related genes, including COBRA, may
indirectly affect XyG structures and pectin content [42]. However,
no cell adhesion phenotype was reported when COBRA was over-
expressed [43]. In contrast, the up-regulated PME gene may affect
methylesterification and hence cell adhesion. Indeed, we observed
increased PME activity in frb1 seedlings (Figure 10A), suggesting
that the frb1 phenotypes may, at least in part, be caused by
decreased pectin esterification [44]. We also performed FTIR
analyses of the crude frb1 cell wall material, which revealed
changes in wave numbers that typically correspond to esterified
pectins (Figures 10B and C). These include three regions [45,46];
region I, which is related to esterified pectins; region II, which
mainly accounts for pectates of un- or de-esterified pectins; and
region III hosting signals for esterified pectins (1443), as well as for
de-esterified pectins (1427, 1420, 1414), suggesting a lower degree
of methylesterification in frb1. These results are congruent with the
decreased PME transcript levels.
Discussion
We identified a gene, FRB1, which encodes a Golgi-localized
protein required for cell adhesion in Arabidopsis. Loss of FRB1
function leads to dramatic changes in cell dissociation and to
ectopic cell adhesion. These opposing phenotypes imply that a
fundamentally different mechanism is affected in frb1 than in other
previously reported cell adhesion-defective mutants. Although we
have so far been unable to determine the molecular function of
FRB1, below we consider a number of possibilities.
The alterations in cell adhesion could link FRB1 to either cuticle
or cell wall metabolism. For example, loss of cuticle or wax at the
cell surface could expose cell wall structures to each other, which
could lead to cell fusions and separation of individual cells from the
surface. The increase in penetration of toluidine blue (Figure S4) in
leaf tissues of the frb1–1 is consistent with loss of epidermal tissue
integrity, and with damage to the cuticle that usually provides an
effective hydrophobic barrier to stain penetration. However, it is
difficult to imagine how this integrity-loss could lead to phenotypes
such as complete organ breakage, where not just surface cells
become separated but also cells in deeper tissues. Consistent with
the latter, neither wax, nor cuticle defective mutants described so
far have cell dissociation phenotypes [47–49]. In addition, most of
the fatty acid processing leading up to wax production occurs in
the endoplasmic reticulum [28] whereas FRB1 is located in the
Golgi. Furthermore, several frb1 mutant phenotypes are evident
during embryo development where the influence of the cuticle is
minimal. We therefore favor that the gene product affects cell wall
components as discussed below, and that it is the gross tissue
disruption that leads to cuticle cracking (Figure S6).
Although XyG (or more specifically the LM15 epitope XXXG
[16]) co-aligns with cell wall micro-domains at the edge of the cell
adhesion plane [17], there is no direct evidence that XyGs disrupt

cell adhesion. Furthermore, none of the mutants affecting XyG
biosynthesis (e.g. [50–54,92]) or metabolism (e.g. [38,55–57])
shows cell adhesion defects. Hence, while we observed changes in
the XyG fine structure, we believe it is unlikely that the organ
fusion or separation in frb1 is directly associated with changes in
XyG metabolism.
The decrease of galactose content in the Golgi, and conse-
quently in the pectic cell wall fraction of frb1, suggests that a
galactose-containing component is dependent on FRB1 function.
Since it is improbable that a loss-of-function mutant would directly
lead to an increase in arabinose incorporation, it is plausible that
the remaining cell wall alterations are affected indirectly in frb1.
Unbranched a-(1–5)-L-Ara and b-(1–4)-D-Gal, as well as the type
I arabinogalactan side chains ([b-(1–4)-D-Gal]n branched at O-3
with short a-(1–3)-L-Ara) of RGI, are turned over during fruit
ripening and softening and are believed to play a role in natural
cell adhesion and separation processes [58], although their specific
roles are poorly understood. It is possible that the observed under-
galactosylation in frb1 may signify a loss in pectic galactan side
chains, which could promote cell separation. In Arabidopsis,
mutations in the RGI arabinosyltransferase, ARAD1 [59] exhibit
a decrease (,50%) in pectic arabinose without showing any cell
dissociation phenotype. Assuming that arabinan and galactan side
chains fulfill related functions during cell adhesion we hypothesize
that FRB1 is more likely involved in protein glycosylation than in
RGI galactosylation. Glycosylation of proteins can occur at
various subcellular sites [60]. The mechanism of O-glycosylation
of AGPs is not well understood and FRB1 activity could be
associated with AGP type II synthesis. In contrast to type I AGPs,
the type II AGPs show more branched galactan structures (b-(1–3)
or (1–6)-D-Gal), which can be terminated by a-(1–3)-L-Ara, a-(1–
5)-L-Ara residues, or by less abundant sugars (reviewed in [61,62]).
Previously described mutations leading to cell adhesion deficien-
cies have been readily explained by reduced abundance of pectins
[18,19,21,23,24,63]. For example, in qua1 mutants, reduced cell
adhesion is accompanied by a 25% reduction in HG levels and
reduced staining with HG specific antibodies [18,63]. In contrast,
we did not observe any reduction in uronic acid levels, and
observed abundant pectic epitopes in frb1, suggesting that FRB1
function is not required for bulk pectin synthesis. However, a PME
was up-regulated in the frb1 mutants, which also corresponded
with an increased PME activity in the mutants. FTIR analyses
further revealed that the degree of methyl-esterification of pectins
was changed, which can affect cell adhesion [19]. Changes in
PME activity may result in both a decrease [19] and increase [64]
in cell adhesive properties, depending on tissues and organs
investigated.
In addition to the possibilities outlined above, FRB1 activity
could influence a class of cell wall proteins that are required for cell
adhesion. For example, several cell wall polymers contain both
arabinose and galactose, including pectins (RGI) and cell wall
glycoproteins. Immunolabeling revealed that the increased arab-
inose content appears to be mainly associated with extensins, i.e. as
estimated using the LM1 antibody. While extensins have not been

directly associated with cell adhesion, it was suggested that
extensins cross-link and provide a template for pectic polymers
[65,66]. It could be that perturbations in extensin deposition and
pectin
methyl-esterification
affect cell
adhesion and
fusion.
Intriguingly, such scenario is supported by both in vitro and in
vivo studies [65,66]. In vitro measurements using atomic force
microscopy and surface plasmon resonance techniques revealed
that extensins and homogalacturonans can be intimately mixed,
and that such interactions affect the surface of layered pectin
polymers, and the water holding ability of the pectins [66].
Furthermore, the charge of pectin polymers, which may be related
to the degree of esterification, and extensins can influence
interactions between the two components. In such a scenario,
certain polymers may become more accessible and perhaps even
change their scaffolding to other wall polymers. This may thus
explain why the surface of the frb1 seedlings were coated with
JIM5 and JIM7 decorated material, despite unaltered uronic acid
levels in the wall. This implies that changes in the structure of the
wall may cause the polymers to be less well integrated.
Finally, a possible function for FRB1 is suggested by remote
homology searches with the FRB1 sequence using PSI-BLAST
[69]. These searches retrieved sequences for protein O-fucosyl-
transferases (POFUT1) from a number of different plant species,
including Arabidopsis (Figure S7). This type of fucosyltransferase is
known to add fucose directly to Ser or Thr in glycoproteins [89].
However, demonstrating that the protein does indeed have this
activity has so far eluded us. The primary limitation has been that
we have not yet determined what the targets for this putative
glycosyltransferase might be. In addition, although FRB1 has
remote similarities to fucosyltransferases, we do not have any
indication that this protein does indeed transfer fucose. Future
work with FRB1 will therefore require systematic and exhaustive
testing of both potential targets and substrates.
In summary, we propose that mutations in FRB1 lead to severe
cell adhesion defects due to a previously unreported mechanism
that affects aspect of cell wall and middle lamella architecture,
including both the pectin and extensin matrices.
Materials and Methods
Plant material and growth conditions
All wild-type and mutant Arabidopsis were ecotype Columbia
(Col-0). Seedlings were grown either under continuous light
(200 mE/m2/s) at 21uC on plates containing half-strength Mur-
ashige and Skoog (MS) mineral salts (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO) or on full strength MS medium complemented with 1%
sucrose under a long day regime (16 h light [200 mE/m2/s], 8 h
darkness). Both were solidified with 0.8% agar.
Cloning of FRB1
T-DNA insertion in frb1–1 plants was mapped by thermal
asymmetric interlaced (TAIL-) PCR according to [67]. The
insertion-specific PCR product was sequenced (700 bp upstream
of the At5g01100 coding region), and confirmed by PCR (Table
S3). Additional insertions at the At5g01100 locus SALK_078459
(frb1–2) and WiscDsLox1D5 (frb1–3), were obtained from the
Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center. The sites of insertion
were confirmed by PCR (Table S3). Transcript levels of FRB1
were assessed by RT-PCR (Table S3).

(Molecular
Evolutionary Genetics Analysis) was used for both sequence
alignment and phylogeny tree building [70], which were further
compared by a neighbor-joining method [71]. JTT matrix-based
method [72] was used to compute evolutionary distance.
Microscopy
Whole seedling micrographs were captured on a Leica MZ16
stereomicroscope equipped with a DFC320 camera. Confocal
images were acquired using
a Nikon inverted microscope
equipped with a BioRad MRC 1024 confocal head with a
krypton-argon laser. All images were compiled and analyzed using
the BioRad software package LaserSharp (BioRad, Hercules, CA)

Maryland). Z-series were obtained by collecting 20–25 mm deep
series (typically 1 mm steps). Movies with GFP::FRB1 transgenic
lines were created by collecting images every 3 seconds for a total
of 40 images and converted to time lapse movies (10 frames per
second). Embryos were stained with analine blue and imaged as
previously described [73].
A method for RNA in situ hybridization previously described by
Weigel and Glazebrook [74] was modified for embedding of
hypocotyls, subsequent transversal sectioning and LM1 and LM6
immunolabeling. Ten
mm tissue sections were prepared in
paraffin, washed and rehydrated in an ethanol series. Non-specific
antibody binding was blocked by incubation in blocking solution
(phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) +3% (w:w) fat free milk powder).
LM1 and LM6 antibodies (Plant Probes, UK) were diluted 1:5 in
blocking solution and incubated overnight at 4uC. Excess of
antibodies were washed three times with PBS for 15 min each.

three times with PBS buffer for15 min each prior to visualization.
For whole mount immuno-localization, unfixed 5 day old
seedlings were incubated in JIM5 or JIM7 rat monoclonal
antibody (CarboSource, USA) diluted 10-fold in 5% skim milk
in PBS for 1 hour; followed by 5 washes in excess PBS and
incubation for 1 hour in goat anti-rat secondary antibody
conjugated to Alexafluor-488 (Molecular Probes, USA), diluted
500-fold in 5% skim milk in PBS. After washing three times in
PBS, seedlings were mounted in AF3 antifade (Citifluor, UK) and
viewed with a confocal microscope. Seedling tissues were prepared
for scanning microscopy and sections prepared for immuno-
localization as previously described [75].
Cell wall extraction and determination of composition
Neutral sugars, uronic acids and cellulose were determined in
10-day-old seedlings grown on MS-media in long day regime.
Plant material was flash-frozen, ground and washed with 70%
ethanol (thoroughly vortexed, spun down 14.000 rpm, 10 min
Eppendorf
table
centrifuge).
The
pellet
was
washed
with
chloroform:methanol (1:1 v/v) as above and was air dried
(CWM). Cell wall polymers and cell wall precursors (oligosaccha-
rides) were acid hydrolyzed prior to sugar analysis. Fractionation
was performed as described in [76]. In detail, plants were
harvested at the end of the night to avoid starch contamination
and cell wall material was obtained as described above. Cell wall
material (10 mg) was resuspended in 1.5 ml CDTA (50 mM),
vortexed and mixed for 6 h at 1100 rpm and RT on an Eppendorf
thermo shaker. The samples were precipitated (14000 rpm,
10 min, Eppendorf table centrifuge) and the supernatants were
stored at 220uC. The pellet was resolved in 1.5 ml CDTA again
and incubated overnight. Samples were centrifuged and the
supernatant was combined with the other CDTA fraction and
stored at 220uC. The procedure was repeated by resolving and
incubating the pellet in 1.5 ml Na2CO3 (50 mM) as described
above. The corresponding Na2CO3 fractions were combined and
stored at 220uC. A third round of extraction was applied by using
1.5 ml of KOH (4 M) as described for the CDTA and Na2CO3
fractions. After combining the two KOH fractions and their
storage at 220uC the pellet was washed three times with water
and subsequent centrifugation (10 min, 14000 rpm) to remove
excess of KOH. The fractions were dialyzed (Spectra/Por3
Dialysis Membrane, MWCO 3500, Spectrum Laboratories) for
two days against three exchanges of 3 L of water at 4uC and under
constant shaking before they were flash frozen and freeze dried.
Matrix polymers were hydrolyzed by 2 M TFA (1 h, 121uC) and
neutral sugars measured as described in [38] modified from [77].
Uronic acids were measured by the m-hydroxybiphenyl/H2SO4
method [78]. To remove 4 M KOH insoluble matrix polysaccha-
rides the pellet was treated with 2 M TFA and the remnant was
considered as cellulose. Cellulose was measured as the amount of
hexoses released by sulphuric acid under constant stirring (72%,
1 h, RT) treatment. Hexoses were determined by anthrone assay
[79].
Sugar
data
derived
from
microsomal
preparations
were
obtained by a modified version from [38] using a Dionex HPAEC
system (ICS 3000) equipped with a CarboPac PA20 column and
PAD detection system (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The
following gradient was applied comprising three phases of isocratic
flow of aqueous NaOH solution (0–20 min: 8 mM, 20–46 min:
771 mM, 46–62 min: 8 mM; flow rate 0.40 ml/min).
For the sequential extraction of uronic acids, 10-day-old
seedlings (as above) were treated with 70% ethanol for 1 h at
70uC. Whole seedlings were then transferred to chloroform:-
methanol (1:1 v/v; 4 h), followed by acetone wash. Seedlings were
air dried for 48 h before dry weight measurements were
performed. Pectin was sequentially extracted (5–10 mg of dry
tissue) with 0.5% ammonium oxalate (25uC, 2 h), washed with
water (2 X), and extracted with 1 M H2SO4 (100uC, 1 h). Uronic
acids were measured as mentioned above [78]. Determination of
the XyG fine structure by Oligosaccharide Mass Profiling
(OLIMP) was performed as described earlier by [38] and
references within [80,81].
GUS expression analysis
A genomic DNA fragment extending ,4.3 kb upstream of the
ATG starting codon for FRB1 was cloned in front of the GUS

gene in pCAMBIA1305.1 ([82]; Table S3), transformed into
plants by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation [83], and GUS
analyses were performed [76] on T3 generation. Tissues were
observed for GUS staining under a dissecting microscope.
Generation of EGFP-FRB1
A full length cDNA of FRB1 was obtained from the Riken
Bioresource Center (Japan), and was sub-cloned into pZERO
(Invitrogen; Table S3). The FRB1 cDNA was excized using
EcoRV and BamHI and the sub-cloned into the SmaI and BamHI
sites of the pEGAD [84] to create an in frame fusion of EGFP with
FRB1. This construct was transformed into Arabidopsis plants by
the floral dip method [85] and selected on soil using 0.25 g/L
Basta. T1 plants were screened for EGFP expression, and etiolated
T2 seedlings were visualized by confocal microscopy. Transient
co-expression of EGFP-FRB1 and m-Cherry Golgi marker (CD3–
967) [33] in N. benthamiana was performed according to [19].
Colocalization EGFP-FRB1 and CD3–967 was captured by a
single laser pass at 100 Hz using a Leica TCS SP5 confocal
microscope using excitation for EGFP and mCherry at 488 nm
and 584 nm respectively.
Microarray hybridizations and analysis
Three replicates of FRB1 and frb1–1 RNA were prepared from
10-day-old seedlings using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to
the manufacturer’s recommendations. RNA processing and cRNA
hybridizations to the Affymetrix ATH1 gene chip were performed
according to a modified Affymetrix protocol developed at the
University of Toronto, Department of Cell and Systems Biology
Affymetrix
Genechip
Facility
(http://www.csb.utoronto.ca/
resources/). All data is MIAME compliant and has been deposited
in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The accession
number for the full dataset is GSE31033.
Raw hybridization data was normalized using MAS 5.0 with a
TGT of 500. Any absent probesets from any of the replicates were
removed from the dataset. Further analysis was done using MS
Excel. AtGenExpress stress datasets [86] (heat, drought, osmotic,
oxidative) were downloaded from the NASCArrays website
(http://affymetrix.arabidopsis.info/). For the four stress datasets,
the up-regulated genes were extracted from each of the time point
(0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24-hour treatment) separated. The final list of
frb1–1 up-regulated list was compared with that of each of the four
stress datasets, and the genes that are up-regulated in both were
identified.
FTIR measurements
Ground cell wall material of 10 day old light grown seedlings
(n$5) was used to measure its transmittance by a Varian 1000
FTIR. Each FTIR spectrum was recorded from 1800 to
800 cm21. Curves were normalized by subtraction of the
minimum value from each data point and the areas below the
graph were transformed into relative arbitrary units by dividing
each data point by the maximum value. Absorbance was
calculated by inverting transmittance to its reciprocal. Five wild-
type samples (n = 5) were averaged whereas minimum two
independent samples of frb1–1, frb1–2 and frb1–3 each were used
to express the average relative absorbance (n = 7).
Cuticle integrity analysis
Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia (Col-0) and the frb1–1
mutant were grown on half-strength MS salts, solidified with 0.8%
agar, under continuous light. 28 days after vernalization plants
were gently rinsed with water to remove agar, then were subjected
to the toluidine blue staining test as described by [87].
PME activity assays
Pectin methylesterase (PME) activity was measured using an
alcohol oxidase coupled assay on 5-day-old light-grown (24 h)
seedlings according to [88]. The PME activity is calculated as the
activity releasing one mole of methanol per second (1 kat).
FRB1 activity assays
FRB1 over-expression in insect cells we carried out using the
BaculoDirect baculovirus expression system from Invitrogen Corp.
A full length FRB1 entry clone was PCR generated using FRB1
forward (59-CACCATGTCAGTCGGCGTTCCAGTG) and re-
verse (59-TTATCTCAGAGATTGTGCTCGTA) primers de-
signed for use with the pENTR//D- TOPO cloning kit from
Invitrogen. The entry clone was then used to create a baculovirus
expression clone with an N-terminal histidine/V5 epitope tag. Sf9
cells were maintained and infections were carried out according to
the
manufacturer’s
recommendations.
Typically,
cells
were
harvested 3 days post-infection from 75 cm2 cell culture dishes
by centrifugation and protein was extracted by incubating the cells
in 0.5 mL cold lysis buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.3, 1% TritonX-
100, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF) for 30 minutes
with shaking. Protein concentrations were determined using a
bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay (Thermo Scientific Pierce).
Standard assays contained 100 mg protein extract, 50 mM Hepes
pH 7.6, 0.2 M sucrose, 0.05% BSA, 100 mM UDP/GDP-sugar,
100 mg acceptor (see below), 1 mM [3H]UDP/GDP-sugar (specific
activity 60 Ci/mmol),1 mM MnCl2 in a final volume of 50 mL.
Samples were incubated for 1 h at 30uC. Reactions were
terminated by adding 900 mL of chloroform:methanol (3:2 v/v)
and centrifuged at 10 000 g for 5 min. The pellet was washed by
re-suspending
in 70% ethanol, sonicating for
15 min and
centrifuging at 10 000 g. This process was repeated at least three
more times. The final pellet was resuspended in 200 mL of 10 mM
EDTA and counted by liquid scintillation. Values in Table S1
were calculated based on total counts per minute for FRB1

acceptor was a membrane protein preparation made from 5
day-old FRB1 seedlings. Membranes were prepared according to a
modified protocol from[90]. Briefly, plant tissue was homogenized
using a mortar and pestle in griding buffer (250 mM sucrose,
50 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 25 mM KCl, 5 mM EDTA , 1 mM
PMSF) at 4C. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 g for
10 min and the supernatant was retained. The supernatant was
centrifuged at 10 000 g for 10 min and the supernatant was
retained. This supernatant was then centrifuged at 100 000 g for
60 min at 4C. Following centrifugation the supernatant was
transferred to a fresh tube (soluble fraction) and the pellet
resuspended in 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.5 using a glass homogenizer
and centrifuged again at 100 000 g for 60 min to yield a pellet
(membrane fraction) that was used for subsequent assays. When
this membrane preparation was used as acceptor it was heat

inactivated at 60uC for 20 min prior to addition to reactions. For
the sugar incorporation assays the membrane preparation was
used immediately. For these assays, membranes were resuspended
in buffer containing 50 mM Hepes pH 7.6, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM
MgCl2, 5 mM MnCl2, 100 mg of protein, 1 mM [H3]UDP-sugar
(specific
activity
60 Ci/mmol).
Triplicates
of
samples
were
incubated at 30uC for 1 hour. The samples were extracted using
chloroform:methanol (2:1) followed by 4 times sequential addition
of equal volumes of water. The organic phase was collected and
proteins precipitated by adding acetone and washing the pellet is
acetone three times. The organic phase represents the ‘‘lipid’’
fraction. Total radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation.
Western blotting
Protein from tobacco leaves expressing GFP-FRB1 or CD3-967
were fractionated into soluble and membrane fractions according
to the protocol described above. Western blotting was done using
standard techniques [91] using anti-GFP (Bioshop, Canada) and
anti-mCherry (Biovisions).

Phylogenetic relationships of FRB1 and its
homologues in the Arabidopsis genome. Evolutionary
history was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method. The
optimal tree with the sum of branch length = 14.99 is shown. The
percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered
together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) is shown next to the
branches. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the
same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the
phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed
using the JTT matrix-based method and are in the units of the
number of amino acid substitutions per site. All positions
containing alignment gaps and missing data were eliminated only
in pairwise sequence comparisons.
